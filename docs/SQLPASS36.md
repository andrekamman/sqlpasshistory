# Field Testing Buffer Pool Extension and In-Memory OLTP Features in SS2014
#### [Back to calendar](#id-36)
Event Date: 25-06-2014 12:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Ross LoForte, Rick Heiges
## Title: Field Testing Buffer Pool Extension and In-Memory OLTP Features in SS2014
## Description:
### SQL Server 2014 ships with powerful new features that can really take your performance to the next level: In-Memory OLTP (Codename "Hekaton") and the Buffer Pool Extension (BPE). In-Memory OLTP unleashes today’s powerful processors and removes the roadblocks to new heights in performance. BPE takes advantage of lightning-fast storage (in the form of Solid State Storage) to effectively and economically expand the amount of usable memory for the system. These two new features were field benchmarked at the MTC Chicago in order to gain an understanding on the behavior, scalability, and use cases where these apply. This session reviews the results of the benchmark testing along with customer examples using each feature.

## Title: SQL Server 2014: In-Memory OLTP Overview
## Description:
### In-Memory OLTP (formerly known as "Hekaton") is a key feature in the in-memory offerings of SQL Server 2014. In this overview session, we discuss user scenarios and hardware trends, such as: decreasing memory cost; many-core processors; stalling CPU clock rate that prompted the key architectural pillars of memory optimization; and no lock/latch concurrency control and native compilation. We’ll also discuss how In-Memory OLTP is integrated into SQL Server.

## Speaker(s): George Li
## Title: SQL Server 2014: In-Memory OLTP End-to-End: Preparing for Migration
## Description:
### SQL Server In-Memory OLTP is a key new feature included in SQL Server 2014. It has been proven to dramatically increase OLTP performance without hardware changes. However, there are numerous nuances in In-Memory OLTP. These nuances mean that not all workloads can derive benefits from In-Memory OLTP. For the workloads that can benefit, care must be taken so that the migration process will enable the workload to take maximum advantage of In-Memory OLTP while keeping efforts down to a minimum. This session uses a sample workload to demonstrate how to plan to migrate to In-Memory OLTP.

## Title: The Role of Polybase in the Modern Data Warehouse
## Description:
### We have all heard about the PolyBase feature of the Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Parallel Data Warehouse, but what are the use cases for this technology? In this session, we explore and demonstrate specific use cases for implementing PolyBase into your Modern Data Warehouse solution. Specifically, we examine how PolyBase can help you: streamline your ETL process by using Hadoop as the staging area of the backroom; export to your Hadoop environment your Enterprise Data Warehouse conformed dimensions; use Hadoop as a low cost, online data archive; and enrich your relational data with ambient data resident in Hadoop.
