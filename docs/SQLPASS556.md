## Speaker(s): Ken Raetz
## Title: Modular Data Extraction and Integration Patterns
## Description:
### Engineers and programmers alike have known for many years that when working with complex systems, you must “divide and conquer” to solve problems efficiently and effectively. This pattern of modularizing application code is a fundamental principle of structured programming and system design, and creates reusability and elegance in applications.

With some adaptation, these same techniques can be applied to data integration and analytics solutions with great success. This webinar will show you how to achieve the same great efficiencies and reusability while solving your analytics problems.  

Learn the techniques used by information technology professionals! You will also see demos in Excel with Power Query, PowerBI.com, and SQL.

## Speaker(s): Ginger Grant
## Title: Implementing Data based Decision Making
## Description:
### Self-Service BI tools have made it easier than ever to move data analysis out of the realm of IT staff and into the hands of business users. To improve the ability of business users to gain insight, a better model would be to have the data team do what they know best: build a model and let the analyst use that model to derive answers to questions with data. Using Power BI, this webinar will define the tasks involved in developing the framework, documentation, and training needed to go from getting data from applications, to analyzing the data to provide meaningful direction, including how the business is doing now and identifying future trends and forecasts.
