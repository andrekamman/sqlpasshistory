## Speaker(s): Avi Singh
## Title: Dueling Dashboards With Power BI and Power Pivot
## Description:
### Microsoft’s evolving strategy in BI and analytics has taken some very exciting turns over the past 12 months. What we used to call the Microsoft BI “platform” could now more appropriately be called an “ecosystem”: a suite of products that truly interoperate, are built upon the same core engines, and revolve around the same core languages.

In this pre-conference preview session, Avi Singh of PowerPivotPro put that ecosystem through its paces for your benefit. He will use real-world examples from his many years of experience, and will cover these patterns in their entirety so you can return to work and apply them immediately. He will provide tips on adapting these patterns to your own needs, with topics including: variance from target/budget, outlier detection, multi-level performance improvement, and Opportunity Gap Analysis.

## Speaker(s): Daniel Fylstra
## Title: Advanced Analytics for Excel Users: Learn How to Do It Yourself
## Description:
### Data science and analytics experts are in great demand today – but if you’re a business analyst using Excel, you might be feeling left out. Take heart, you really can do advanced analytics yourself in Excel, from forecasting, data and text mining, and predictive analytics, to Monte Carlo simulation, risk analysis, and optimization – and you can use your models and results with other desktop and cloud-based tools. In 50 minutes we can’t turn you into an analytics expert, but in this session we can show you what’s possible (and easy) to do in Excel.
