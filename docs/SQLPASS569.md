## Title: Advanced Analytics for Excel Users: Learn How to Do It Yourself
## Description:
### Data science and analytics experts are in great demand today – but if you’re a business analyst using Excel, you might be feeling left out. Take heart, you really can do advanced analytics yourself in Excel, from forecasting, data and text mining, and predictive analytics, to Monte Carlo simulation, risk analysis, and optimization – and you can use your models and results with other desktop and cloud-based tools. In 50 minutes we can’t turn you into an analytics expert, but in this session we can show you what’s possible (and easy) to do in Excel.
