# SQL Server 2016 AlwaysOn Availability Groups Enhancements
#### [Back to calendar](#id-603)
Event Date: 25-05-2016 14:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): J May
## Title: SQL Server 2016 AlwaysOn Availability Groups Enhancements
## Description:
### AlwaysOn Availability Groups (AGs) were introduced in SQL Server 2012. AGs significantly expanded our HA/DR options. However, in both SQL 2012 and SQL 2014 two limitations were extant in the code—both Network Transport and Log Redo significantly compromised performance.  In SQL Server 2016, these limitations have been significantly improved. Our work shows enhancements of 7x - 10x, allowing over 1/2GB/s (4Gb/s) across the wire. These improvements expand solutions options for Tier 1 OLTP and Data Warehouse workloads, Tier 1 and Tier 2 consolidation,  and more.  This presentation explains the improvements, characterizes the new solutions, and shows commodity servers and modern non-shared in-server flash storage showing the profound contrast between SQL Server 2014 vs. 2016. Doing so moves the perf bottleneck from the SQL Server codebase to the CPU where it belongs.

## Description:
### Enterprise database requirements such as security, availability, scaling, recovery and performance are expensive and complex to implement and maintain. Amazon Web Services simplifies database ownership, making it easy to set up, operate, and scale databases, including SQL Server, in the AWS cloud. With just a few clicks, you can deploy enterprise-class databases, enabling a new level of agility for business.

Attend this webinar for an in-depth look at how AWS customers like Unilever, Hearst, Rovio and Prezi are using RDS SQL Server in concert with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud to improve security, and with the Multi-Availability-Zone feature to provide high availability. Learn how RDS customers easily scale up the power of their databases without downtime, and achieve fast, consistent, and predictable performance through AWS Provisioned IOPS.
 
In this session, you will also learn about:
-          Implementing database security within AWS through storage-level encryption, network layer controls, Instance and data access controls, and encrypted connections using SSL
-         Sizing RDS SQL Server instances to meet workload demands
-         Monitoring database performance using Amazon CloudWatch, and adding alarms & notifications
-     Migrating and replicating data into AWS and also between database engine types with minimal downtime using the AWS Database Migration Service

# Temporal Tables and Their Role in ETL and Data Warehouse
#### [Back to calendar](#id-603)
Event Date: 26-05-2016 00:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Reza Rad
## Title: Temporal Tables and Their Role in ETL and Data Warehouse
## Description:
### Temporal tables are new type of database tables introduced in SQL Server 2016, these tables are system-versioned and keep history of changes (insert, delete, update) of everything happened on data rows. Retrieving change log from these tables are easy. These tables can simply tell you what was the data at specific point of the time in the table. These tables works with datetime2 columns to keep FROM DATE and TO DATE information of each change. This means these tables can be used for implementing changes in dimensions, yes you know what it called; Slowly Changing Dimension!

In this session you will learn how Temporal Tables works, and you will also learn through live demos how to use it in your Data Warehouse for Slowly Changing Dimension. You also learn some tips and tricks when you work with Temporal Tables for SCD implementation.

## Title: Relational Databases vs Non-Relational Databases vs Hadoop
## Description:
### There is a lot of confusion about the place and purpose of the many recent non-relational database solutions (“NoSQL databases”) compared to the relational database solutions that have been around for so many years.  

In this presentation I will first clarify what exactly these database solutions are, how they compare to Hadoop, and discuss the best use cases for each.  I’ll discuss topics involving OLTP, scaling, data warehousing, polyglot persistence, and the CAP theorem.  We will even touch on a new type of database solution called NewSQL.  If you are building a new solution it is important to understand all your options so you take the right path to success.

### Elastic Database tools for Azure SQL Database employ well-established industry patterns for sharding to dynamically scale an application’s data tier. Using Elastic Database tools, applications can now scale database capacity elastically as demand fluctuates. This session will do a deep dive into Elastic Database Client Library (now open sourced) and Elastic Database Transactions, covering the following aspects: 1) different tenancy models for sharding that we observed while working with customers 2) implementing the tenancy models using Elastic Database Client Library 3) performing data dependent routing for application requests 4) processing requests across shards 5) running distributed transactions across multiple databases or shards. Throughout the session, we will use .NET demos to illustrate these capabilities. 

Objectives

1. Build Scaled-out applications using Elastic Database Client Library

2. Execute transactions spanning across multiple databases in Azure SQL
