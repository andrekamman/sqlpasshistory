## Title: Text Analytics Case Study:  Bank’s Corporate Responsibility Reports
## Description:
### The analysis of text documents is rapidly growing in importance and not just of social media  but also for legal, academic and financial documents.   We'll use a case study based on the analysis of a bank's corporate responsibility reports to learn  some techniques; frequency analysis, finding words and phrases specific to one or a few documents in a collection, and key phrase detection.  We'll use a variety of tools; R, text analytics web services and Power BI.
