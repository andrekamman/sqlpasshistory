Event Date: 09-09-2014 14:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: Availability Groups vs. Failover Cluster Instances: What’s the Difference?
## Description:
### Both availability groups (AGs) and clustered instances of SQL Sevrer (FCIs) use an underlying Windows Server failover cluster (WSFC). But how are they different since they both rely on the same plumbing? This session will explain how AGs and FCIs use WSFCs in similar, yet different, ways.

# In-Memory OLTP Internals: How is a 30x Performance Boost Possible?
#### [Back to calendar](#id-38)
Event Date: 09-09-2014 15:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: In-Memory OLTP Internals: How is a 30x Performance Boost Possible?
## Description:
### SQL Server Hekaton, a.k.a. In-Memory OLTP, will completely change the way you think about data management. As a DBA, you’ll need to analyze your memory and storage needs completely differently. All Hekaton data is always stored in memory, and the data stored on disk is basically just a REDO log used to regenerate the contents of your memory-optimized tables. 

n this session, Kalen Delaney (a SQL Server MVP for over 20 years) will show you the in-memory architecture for your Hekaton data and indexes, and discuss what gets written to disk during checkpoints. Finally, she’ll go into detail on just what it is that makes Hekaton so much FASTER!

## Speaker(s): Jonathan Kehayias, Erin Stellato
## Title: Everything You Never Wanted to Know about Extended Events
## Description:
### Let's cut to the chase: it's time to start using Extended Events (XE). We know you have your reasons for avoiding them, but it's time to leave SQL Trace and Profiler behind and enter the new world of XE. In this 45-minute session, we can't quite cover *everything* about Extended Events, but we can highlight selected use cases that already exist for XE which are easy to leverage, add immediate value, and require minimal effort for implementation.  

We hope you'll take this opportunity to see why Extended Events has so much offer, and learn how you can start using them in your environment today.

## Speaker(s): Gail Shaw
## Title: Guessing Games: Statistics, Heuristics, and Row Estimations
## Description:
### Estimated rows: 17.5862. Ever wonder how the query optimizer comes up with these row estimations? The usual answer is “statistics,” but there’s so much more than that involved.In this session, we’ll look at the methods which the query optimizer uses to generate accurate, and sometimes not so accurate, row counts for operators in a query plan. We’ll take a look at some of the common causes of row estimation errors and what can be done about them. We’ll finish up by looking at the changes introduced in this area with SQL Server 2014.

## Title: Troubleshoot Customer Performance Problems Like a Microsoft Engineer
## Description:
### In this session Microsoft Principal field engineer Denzil Ribeiro and Senior field engineer Tim Chapman show you how you can use free public tools to create your own performance data captures for your environment and how you can customize these tools to upload and analyze the data.  All of the tools used are publicly available.  You will be shown the exact steps we take when we use these tools and we will share all of the configurations we have created so that you can use them in your environment.

## Speaker(s): Chris Shaw, John Morehouse
## Title: Real World SQL 2014 Migration Path Decisions
## Description:
### The mission is clear: update your SQL Server to SQL Server 2014. But this may be where the clarity ends. What method do you intend to use? Have you considered the benefits and drawbacks to the most common upgrade methods? Have you been given what may sound like impossible requirements such as the database can only be down for 10 minutes? 

In this session, we will talk about the options each upgrade path has, preparing you to take control of the upgrade and not let it control you. John Morehouse and Chris Shaw have experienced many of the requirements that you may be faced with today, and by attending this session, you will:

• Be able to identify the different upgrade paths and what makes them a strong option.
• Learn the critical decision points that are the difference between success and failure.
• Be able to discuss upgrade options and then plan around them like a seasoned pro.

## Speaker(s): Davide Mauri
## Title: Agile Data Warehousing: Start to Finish
## Description:
### This session will be a preview of Davide Mauri's PASS Summit 2014 Agile Data Warehousing Workshop. First, we'll go over what a Data Warehouse is (and I’m sure you’ll be amazed to know what it really is!) and why it is still needed even in today’s in-memory no-sql hype. Of course it has challenges that *must* be solved in order to be sure it’s ready to handle always changing business requirements. This is where engineering comes into play, because agility without engineering is anarchy. And with all the company data at our hands we cannot afford this. 

We'll go over the tools and the methodology that can be used to streamline the production; the maintenance and the evolution of a Data Warehouse; cutting cost where there is no value and investing time; and using resources where appropriate. Everything will be done using the SQL Server Data Platform at its full potential.

## Speaker(s): Alberto Ferrari
## Title: DAX Formulas in Action 
## Description:
### In this demo-heavy session, Alberto Ferrari will show you how to build a working prototype of a Business Intelligence solution using the DAX language in Excel and SQL Server Management Studio. 

We will start with the Contoso database in Excel and perform some basic analysis using the DAX language to create calculated columns and measures, to obtain a good, yet effective, PivotTable analysis. Then, we will promote the prototype to a SQL Server Analysis Services database to run queries that will be the source of a Reporting Services report (not shown). 

The goal of the session is to let you see the kind of analysis you can obtain with just a basic understanding of the DAX language.

## Speaker(s): Jen Stirrup
## Title: Business Intelligence Toolkit Overview: Microsoft Power BI and R
## Description:
### The "why" of Business Intelligence is every bit as important as the "how" we do it technically. Business Intelligence is about people first, technology second, knitted together by process.

In this session, we will look at an overview of theory and scientific evidence about data visualization. We will also look at an overview of the Power BI suite of tools in terms of data visualization and the utility of R for its ability to support our analyses in everyday life.We will look at the following technologies in an end-to-end environment: RPower PivotPower QueryPower ViewPower MapExcel. The end result is that we will look at creating dashboards in Power BI tools and Excel. 

To summarize, this session aims to deliver a breadth of data visualization knowledge, underpinned by cognitive psychology theory to provide deeper understanding of data visualization, and translated into Microsoft Power BI functionality.

## Description:
### In this session, we will discuss what the SQL Server AlwaysOn high availability and disaster recovery solution is all about. We’ll also talk about the different levels of protection it provides through Windows Clustering, SQL Clustering, and Availability Groups. We'll then talk about how these three things come together to protect your databases, and finish with a dive into availability group configuration, the new capabilities it gives us, and what's new in SQL Server 2014.
