## Speaker(s): Bob Ward
## Title: Getting Started with Performance Monitoring in Azure SQL
## Description:
### Are you familiar with performance monitoring with SQL Server? Come learn the basics of how to translate your knowledge to monitoring performance with Azure SQL Virtual Machine, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Managed Instance. We will show you what is the same, what is different, and what is new and adds value to your performance monitoring experience with SQL databases hosted in the Azure.

## Speaker(s): Glenn Berry
## Title: Hardware 301: Evaluating and Choosing Database Hardware for SQL Server 2019
## Description:
### Microsoft made some sweeping changes to their software licensing model for SQL Server 2012, moving from socket-based licensing to core-based licensing. This new licensing model alters much of the conventional criteria for hardware selection for database servers that will be running SQL Server 2012 and newer. This change still causes a significant amount of angst, with fears of huge increases in SQL Server licensing costs compared to older versions of the product. 

This session will cut through the uncertainty and hype to show you how to properly evaluate and choose your database hardware for usage with SQL Server 2012 and newer. You will learn how to choose hardware for different types of workloads and how to get the best performance and scalability for the lowest licensing cost, whether you are running in a physical or virtualized environment.

## Speaker(s): Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: Query Store: An Introduction
## Description:
### SQL Server’s Query Data Store is a brilliant option for databases if you are a DBA or have to do performance tuning on T-SQL queries. This feature of SQL Server 2016 or higher is contained within a database with configuration options for storage of history and query plans. The option has many benefits you can take advantage of today, but also this is an option for future upgrades to new SQL Server versions because of the history contained in the database rather than the instance.

## Speaker(s): Allen White
## Title: Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline with PowerShell
## Description:
### Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

# T-SQL Performance Troubleshooting
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1138)
Event Date: 31-03-2020 23:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Vern Rabe
## Title: T-SQL Performance Troubleshooting
## Description:
### There are many ways to troubleshoot SQL Server performance issues, but in my experience fixing poorly written T-SQL often results in the greatest performance improvements. How do you identify poorly written T-SQL? 

In this session we’ll start with a brief overview of the graphical execution plan and how to use it to home in on performance issue causes. We’ll then look at several (unfortunately common) T-SQL patterns that can hurt query performance. We’ll discuss how to identify those patterns, explain why they perform poorly, and demonstrate better methods to write them. There will be lots of code demonstrations of both the good and the bad T-SQL.
