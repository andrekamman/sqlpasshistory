## Speaker(s): Tibor Karaszi
## Title: Making the GUI work for you
## Description:
### Many of us have a love-hate relationship with the GUI, SQL Server Management Studio primarily. After teaching SQL Server for two decades, I see people struggle with the GUI, but at the same time are dependent on it. The purpose of this presentation is to describe how you have a conflict-free relationship with the GUI, forgive and work around its weaknesses and take advantage of its strengths.

# Make my day, Distributed Replay

Event Date: 08-11-2011 15:45 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: DBA
## Speaker(s): Raoul Illyes, Erling Skaale
## Title: Make my day, Distributed Replay
## Description:
### Stress testing a system from a DBA´s perspective has almost been impossible using the old replay functionality that came with the profiler, since it was limited to only be able to replay workload from a single host. In Denali, Distributed Replay is a new multi-threaded replay utility that removes this limit by allowing you to spread the workload of the replay, utilizing multiple servers. In this session you will see first-hand how the whole distributed replay process works, how to do pre-upgrade stress testing and finally produce some understandable results.

# Knowing the Internals, Who Needs SQL Server Anyway?

Event Date: 09-11-2011 09:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: DBA
## Speaker(s): Mark S. Rasmussen
## Title: Knowing the Internals, Who Needs SQL Server Anyway?
## Description:
### You're stuck on a remote island with just a laptop and your main database .MDF file. The boss calls and asks you to retrieve some data, but alas, you forgot to install SQL Server on your laptop. Luckily you have a HEX editor by your side! 

In this level 500 deep dive session we will go into the intimate details of the MDF file format. Think using DBCC Page is pushing it? Think again! As a learning experiment, I've created an open source parser for MDF files, called OrcaMDF. Using the OrcaMDF parser I'll go through the primary storage mechanisms, how to parse page headers, boot pages, internal system tables, data & index records, b-tree structures as well as the supporting IAM, GAM, SGAM & PFS pages. 

Has your database suffered an unrecoverable disk corruption? This session might just be your way out! Using a corrupt & unattachable MDF file, I'll demo how to recover as much data as possible. This session is not for the faint of heart, there will be bytes!

The session first describes the limitations and shortcomings of traditional, or classic, T-SQL constructs that are used to address common querying tasks. It then explains how window functions address those limitations very elegantly and efficiently. The session describes the gradual improvements in SQL Server's support for window functions initially in SQL Server 2005 and then with more complete support in SQL Server Denali.

# Using Correlated Tracing to Diagnose Query Level Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#id-8)
Event Date: 09-11-2011 10:15 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: DBA
## Speaker(s): Jerome Halmans
## Title: Using Correlated Tracing to Diagnose Query Level Performance
## Description:
### Diagnosing production issues affecting Microsoft SQL Server can be difficult and time consuming. Determining whether the problem lies in the client or the server adds even more difficulty.  With SQL Server code name “Denali”, diagnostic capabilities have been enhanced with Extended Events and integration with Data Access Trace. These enhancements provide the capability to trace requests from clients to the lowest levels of SQL Server, find resource contention and determine what is really slowing down your queries.  

This talk will focus on using the diagnostic capabilities of Extended Events, which provides visibility into the internal operations of SQL Server and how these capabilities can be combined with client traces to pinpoint the source of production issues.

## Speaker(s): 
## Title: ColumnStore Index in action
## Description:
### How much faster queries can run using a ColumnStore index? How do these indexes make queries run so fast? These are common questions that customers and partners are asking since this new technology emerged in the first Denali CTPs. In this session we’ll talk about how the technology works and what kind of queries will benefit from this new index type, trying to understand why batch mode processing have to do with that and which best practices are emerging from early customer experiences on real world data.

# Delivering KPIs with Analysis Services
#### [Back to calendar](#id-8)
Event Date: 09-11-2011 12:45 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: BI
## Speaker(s): Peter Myers
## Title: Delivering KPIs with Analysis Services
## Description:
### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are important measurements that influence behavior and allow an organization to evaluate whether they are meeting target for specific objectives. This session will commence by introducing how KPIs are defined in Analysis Services, in both the Unified Dimensional Model (UDM) and the upcoming release of PowerPivot, and then made available for consistent reporting using Excel, Excel Services, Reporting Services and PerformancePoint Services.

Next, consideration will be given to where the KPI sources its target data from. The session will explore additional capabilities of the UDM to collect planning data, specifically by using cube write-back, and Data Mining to seed planning values.

Finally, the session will introduce how the Excel 2010 What-If Analysis feature can be used to support the collection of planning data from users.

# Event-Driven Stream Processing with Microsoft StreamInsight
#### [Back to calendar](#id-8)
Event Date: 09-11-2011 13:45 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Developer
## Speaker(s): Roman Schindlauer
## Title: Event-Driven Stream Processing with Microsoft StreamInsight
## Description:
### Microsoft StreamInsight is a comprehensive development platform for building event-driven applications in .NET. While typical relational database applications are query-driven, event-driven applications are characterized by high event data rates, continuous standing queries, and millisecond latency requirements that make it impractical to store the data in a relational database for processing. Event driven application workloads are common in many different industries, including manufacturing, oil and gas, utilities, financial services, health care, retail, web analytics and data center monitoring. In this session we will provide an overview of the platform, explore common scenarios, and talk about new features in StreamInsight V1.2, which has been released in July 2011. Moreover, we will provide a preview into project codename Austin, a Cloud service that lets you provision and run StreamInsight on Windows Azure.

## Speaker(s): Benjamin Sigursteinsson
## Title: Slowly Changing Dimensions – Features vs. Performance
## Description:
### This session will give examples of different approaches to loading Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD), type 1 and type 2.  This is one of the bottlenecks in loading data warehouses and pros and cons of the most common approaches will be explored.    Tools used will be SSIS (3rd party solutions and Microsoft‘s own SCD Wizard)  and T-SQL.  For those not familiar with SCD‘s, a quick introduction will be made.
