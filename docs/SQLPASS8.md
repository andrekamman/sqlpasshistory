### Having conqueried the bulk API and hit 16M rows/sec, we turn our eyes to other workloads to see just how hard we can push SQL Server before it breaks.

In this session, I will take simple SQL statements, the stuff you write every day, and bump up the scale until things start breaking. I will attempt to answer questions like

- How fast can you read rows from SQL?
- How many INSERT statements can you run per sec 
- Is UPDATE really so bad?
- How does index build scale? 
- And how fast can you build a Denali column store?
- Just how many IOPS can you squeeze out of a modern machine running Windows? (Give those SAN guys something to think about)
- Just how fast can you table scan from disk? (and how do you test it?)

## Speaker(s): Kevin Kline
## Title: Ten Crucial Dev Skills That Will Keep Your DBA Happy
## Description:
### Stereotypes abound for different types of people in the IT world. Developers think DBAs are control freaks.  DBAs think developers are unruly cowboys. How do we overcome these differences?  If you’re a developer, your best strategy is to manage your DBAs’ anxieties and demonstrate your competence and credibility.  Attend this session to learn about 10 techniques that developers can apply to calm their DBAs’ fears and earn their admiration.   
This session will answer questions like:

-	What’s the most common Transact-SQL programming mistake and how do I fix it?
-	How do database designers cause problems for future generations of application developers and database administrators?
-	Why do inexperienced database administrators make their own job more difficult and less efficient? 

There are a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier.  These mistakes are the “low hanging fruit” of application design, development, and administration.  Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.

# Programming Patterns with BISM Tabular
#### [Back to calendar](#id-8)
Event Date: 08-11-2011 14:15 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: BI
## Speaker(s): Alberto Ferrari
## Title: Programming Patterns with BISM Tabular
## Description:
### BISM, the new way of modeling data in SSAS, implements the DAX programming language as one of the options to author complex calculations. Moreover, in BISM there is the new Tabular data model, in pair with the Multidimensional data model we are used to adopt since the birth of SSAS. Both these environments are quite new and somehow inexplored.
In this session the speaker is going to analyze some common data modeling scenarios, take a quick  view at the Multidimensional implementation and then perform a deep dive into the Tabular/DAX solution of the same data model, paying attention to the main differences in the approach of the two methodologies.
Using examples of various complexity, the goal is to show how to leverage the DAX programming language and the Tabular data model to solve common scenarios.

## Speaker(s): Raoul Illyes, Erling Skaale
## Title: Make my day, Distributed Replay
## Description:
### Stress testing a system from a DBA´s perspective has almost been impossible using the old replay functionality that came with the profiler, since it was limited to only be able to replay workload from a single host. In Denali, Distributed Replay is a new multi-threaded replay utility that removes this limit by allowing you to spread the workload of the replay, utilizing multiple servers. In this session you will see first-hand how the whole distributed replay process works, how to do pre-upgrade stress testing and finally produce some understandable results.

## Title: Knowing the Internals, Who Needs SQL Server Anyway?
## Description:
### You're stuck on a remote island with just a laptop and your main database .MDF file. The boss calls and asks you to retrieve some data, but alas, you forgot to install SQL Server on your laptop. Luckily you have a HEX editor by your side! 

In this level 500 deep dive session we will go into the intimate details of the MDF file format. Think using DBCC Page is pushing it? Think again! As a learning experiment, I've created an open source parser for MDF files, called OrcaMDF. Using the OrcaMDF parser I'll go through the primary storage mechanisms, how to parse page headers, boot pages, internal system tables, data & index records, b-tree structures as well as the supporting IAM, GAM, SGAM & PFS pages. 

Has your database suffered an unrecoverable disk corruption? This session might just be your way out! Using a corrupt & unattachable MDF file, I'll demo how to recover as much data as possible. This session is not for the faint of heart, there will be bytes!

 - Applying Best Practices to Multivariate Statistics

Demonstrations will be carried out using SQL Server 2008 R2. This presentation will assume a basic familiarity of Reporting Services. This session is aimed at Business Intelligence specialists with some familiarity with Reporting Services. Ultimately, it is intended for those who would like to produce effective reports by working smarter rather than harder. Come and learn how to win the Red Queen's Race by moving your reporting forwards, not running on the spot!

## Speaker(s): André Kamman
## Title: RoboDBA
## Description:
### How do you manage a large environment? 

I was a DBA for more than  400 instances.

•Did I do all that by myself? 
•Was the whole environment standardised ?
•Did nothing ever go wrong?
•Did I look through all the error logs on a daily basis by hand?

Of course the answer to all these questions is a big fat NO.

I'll explain how managing a large environment like this works, and I'll do it in such a way that even if you have 5 instances, this should still be useful.

Expect 50% processes and war stories and 50% scripts and demos (lots of PowerShell of course, but not everything)

## Title: "Cursors are Evil"
## Description:
### "Cursors are evil,  and shouldnt be used."

Thats frequent advice given on forums when asking about performance problems.
Its correct advice, but how do you go about removing cursors and what do you replace them with ? Thats the tricky part!

By deconstructing a cursor based routine, Dave will demonstrate a number of TSQL techniques and how they can be applied to generate a new routine with significantly less overhead.

## Speaker(s): Benjamin Sigursteinsson
## Title: Slowly Changing Dimensions – Features vs. Performance
## Description:
### This session will give examples of different approaches to loading Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD), type 1 and type 2.  This is one of the bottlenecks in loading data warehouses and pros and cons of the most common approaches will be explored.    Tools used will be SSIS (3rd party solutions and Microsoft‘s own SCD Wizard)  and T-SQL.  For those not familiar with SCD‘s, a quick introduction will be made.
