## Speaker(s): Dean Abbott
## Title: Turning Membership Surveys into Action with Predictive Analytics
## Description:
### Matching predictive analytics solutions to business needs can present significant challenges for data scientists, often because models and data visualization are not always readily understandable except for analysts steeped in technology. This talk describes a real-world survey analysis solution that began with the best of intentions, but did not resonate with the business stakeholders. A second solution is described, showing a far more understandable solution that provided far greater interperation of the survey results.

### The practice of Data Science has arrived and as data professionals we're on the forefront of this change. The data we collect can now be used in new and exciting ways, providing more value than ever before. To get started in this field, a number of tools and methodologies must be employed to help you achieve predictive analytics success with your data. In this session, we will start by providing an introduction to R, a foundation programming language for data scientists.  Carlos will then cover predictive analytics using T-SQL  and R, providing a practical understanding of what it takes to develop your own predictive models making the most of the expertise you already have. The session includes an overview of definitions, concepts and terminology, successful applications of predictive analytics, and how predictive analytics fits into a BI environment.

## Speaker(s): Yana Berkovich
## Title: Azure Machine Learning Studio and PowerBI
## Description:
### There are so many tools for data analysis and prediction. Let's explore the Azure ML lab vs PowerBI, how can each of them be used? What are their differences?

In this session you will learn the differences between loading data in the Azure ML Lab vs into PowerBI. We will discuss the cleansing of data in both tools, as well as analyzing existing data (the OOTB for each tool). We will then build a simple prediction model and summarize and compare the results.
