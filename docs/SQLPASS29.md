## Speaker(s): Jason Strate
## Title: Implementation and Design on the Parallel Data Warehouse
## Description:
### If you need to design a data warehouse that scales for today and into the future, then you need to know about Microsoft's Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW). In this full-day session, we will review the architecture of PDW with an emphasis on what makes PDW the solution of choice for data warehouses.

We will discuss what it takes to migrate a data warehouse to PDW and what bottlenecks you could expect to see in a migration. Through live demonstrations, you will witness the power and performance of PDW and see the performance impact of PDW's data distribution.

This session will also explore the successes that real-world clients already on PDW are seeing and why it is the key to future data warehouses. By the end of the day, you will have a clear understanding of the value that PDW can provide your organization when it comes to performance and scale.

# PowerPivot: Fundamentals and Patterns to Make You Effective TODAY
#### [Back to calendar](#id-29)
Event Date: 07-05-2014 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker(s): Rob Collie
## Title: PowerPivot: Fundamentals and Patterns to Make You Effective TODAY
## Description:
### PowerPivot is a technology full of surprises: while still perceived as “brand new,” in reality it reflects 15+ years of ongoing development at Microsoft.  Armed with that industrial-strength depth, you will conquer an unlimited spectrum of analytical, reporting, and modeling needs.

The next surprise, however, is even better: a remarkable simplicity underlies all of that power. In fact, the most useful capabilities are conveniently the most learnable.

In this Pre-conference session, Rob Collie has filtered his years of PowerPivot education, writing, and consulting experience down to that set – the things anyone can learn and retain in a short period of time, while simultaneously building a confident foundation for future learning. He brings the technology’s power to you, not vice versa. Together, we will take a 100% human and pragmatic approach.  

But that down-to-earth approach, geared toward absolute beginners, will give you analytical superpowers. This learning strategy is built on four pillars:

1. Fundamentals – short and simple, these fit onto a single 6-step flowchart (provided).
2. Patterns – “recipes” that you can easily follow and modify to solve business problems, without requiring PhD-level mastery.
3. Priorities – focused on the capabilities that are most “bang for the buck.”  Avoids topics that are too complex or too “niche.”
4. Examples – there is no reference guide quite like a working example that you can revisit when needed. Each student will take home dozens of such examples in workbook form.

The only prerequisite is that you enjoy data. Join us for the revolution.

# Superhero Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#id-29)
Event Date: 07-05-2014 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker(s): Peter Myers
## Title: Superhero Power BI
## Description:
### Persona, heroic deeds, and the right gadgets are the making of a true superhero. In this day-long Pre-conference session, learn how Power BI can enable the superhero in you to thwart evil deeds - aka "no data", "old data," and the all-too-common "incomplete data."

The aim of this session is to excite you with the potential of Microsoft's new self-service suite of BI products and collaboration platform, called Power BI. You will learn about four “Power” authoring products available in Excel and how they function to discover, acquire, transform, relate, and enrich data for analysis and reporting. Topics include Power Query, PowerPivot, Power View, and Power Map.

You will also learn how to effectively share and collaborate on Power BI solutions in the cloud with Office 365. Topics include data refresh to on-premise data, the data catalog to search for data queries, natural language query (Q&A) to intuitively query data, and a mobile application for Power BI.

This session has been designed to provide perspective across the Power BI story. Theory and an end-to-end series of real-world demonstrations will allow you to appreciate how the Power BI products span on-premise and cloud environments and how they attain super-strength as they work together.

# Data Science Master Class: Exploring More Exotic Patterns in Data
#### [Back to calendar](#id-29)
Event Date: 07-05-2014 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker(s): Mark Whitehorn
## Title: Data Science Master Class: Exploring More Exotic Patterns in Data
## Description:
### What’s the connection between random walks and gas-powered refrigerators? Attend this Pre-conference session to find out and to add valuable techniques to your data science toolbox.

Data science requires us to see and understand complex patterns in data. We use techniques such as data mining to uncover them. However, there are other, less well-known but equally useful techniques and methodologies directly applicable to data science that we can add to our toolbox, including:

• Monte Carlo simulations
• Nyquist’s Theorem
• Techniques for handling outliers
• Type 1, 2, and 3 errors
• False positives
• Simpson’s paradox
• Benford’s Law

This session will NOT include any heavy (or, indeed, light!) mathematics; instead, it will focus on how understanding these techniques can help you understand complex data patterns in your day-to-day work.

Understanding random walks, for instance, is mathematically so complex that Einstein worked on the problem. Happily, non-mathematicians can use Monte Carlo simulations to understand them. (The connection from the question above is that Einstein also held a US patent, No. 1,781,541, for a gas-powered fridge).

 In this session, you will see how Monte Carlo simulations are highly applicable to business problems, such as optimizing web design; how Nyquist’s Theorem can be used to tell us, for example, how often to sample smart electricity meters; and much more.

# Analytics and OLTP Systems: Is Hekaton a Game-Changer?
#### [Back to calendar](#id-29)
Event Date: 08-05-2014 11:15 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker(s): Todd McDermid
## Title: Analytics and OLTP Systems: Is Hekaton a Game-Changer?
## Description:
### BI professionals know that the workloads of analytic applications are very different than those of ERP systems. They have also seen the impacts of trying to make those OLTP databases support both analytics and LOB applications. Performance suffers, development time increases, and end-user satisfaction drops for both systems.

Business analysts should be very skeptical about tool vendor claims of being able to drop analytics on top of existing systems "in days" or "weeks." At a business analyst level, this session will explain why those poor outcomes happen and what techniques data professionals can use to overcome them.

The landscape has changed a little with PowerPivot, allowing in-memory analytics on what appears to be more traditional data. But now a real game-changer might be on the horizon, in Microsoft's Hekaton engine. Is it the vehicle for the perfect combination of LOB data with analytics? Or does the dream of one database for all purposes remain out of reach?

# Using Hive to Query and Process Big Data
#### [Back to calendar](#id-29)
Event Date: 08-05-2014 13:30 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Big Data
## Speaker(s): Dan Clark
## Title: Using Hive to Query and Process Big Data
## Description:
### Writing Map-Reduce jobs to process data is not a trivial task. To be effective, you really need to be a seasoned Java or C# programmer. Even then, it’s a time-consuming experience. Say hello to Hive - a very useful tool for creating and running Map-Reduce jobs in Hadoop.

HiveQL is a declarative language modeled to provide a similar experience as writing SQL. If you are familiar with SQL, using HiveQL should be intuitive. With HiveQL, you construct and run the statement, submitting it to a query engine. The query engine then transforms the query into a series of Map-Reduce jobs. By not having to worry about the low-level coding, you become much more productive and can concentrate on data analysis.

This session, designed to get you up to speed and productive with Hive, includes several practical examples to make data analysis with Hive as concrete as possible.

## Speaker(s): Cristian Vava
## Title: The True Value of Your Data Analytics Project
## Description:
### Have you seen these headlines? “Data Science is the sexiest job in the 21st century.” “Netflix never used its $1 million algorithm due to engineering costs.” History has taught us that revolutionary technologies may bring huge profits to early adopters, but they can also be very risky. Without a serious cost-benefit analysis, a complex data analytics project may not only fail, but could also cause irreparable damage to the organization relying on it.

The popular belief is that a data science project will deliver a complete mathematical model describing all dependencies and interactions that have eluded experts in the field, letting us automate and optimize everything from business processes to health care. In reality, data science has its limitations. And the promised accuracy, although it has a certain allure in the scientific and financial worlds, also brings new risks and substantial unforeseen costs.

This session will examine the true value of a data analytics project in a business context, using practical examples to help you plan ahead and manage expectations.

## Speaker(s): Rob Collie, Michael Miskell
## Title: The Reality of “Industrial Strength” Excel – A Case Study
## Description:
### In early 2013, Kaman Industrial Technologies faced a problem:  pressure from a softening economy was weighing on sales and margins, impacting bottom-line profitability. 
 
Bottom line trends at public companies, however, are a “blend” of myriad smaller trends – in Kaman’s case, 180+ business locations make up the overall result, and any fixes would need to be implemented at that level.
 
The first obstacle was to pinpoint the likeliest opportunities for improvement – to build a unified system of measurement that could drive potentially thousands of “micro changes” in the field while maintaining visibility at the executive level.
 
Traditional BI methodologies were unable to fill that need.  Director of Process Management, Mike Miskell, was tapped to find alternate methods. The results are dramatic: Mike and another employee, with occasional coaching from consultant Rob Collie, built the entire required measurement framework in four short months.
 
Come hear the “how” and the “why” of industrial strength Excel.

# Regularization in Regression and Deep Learning Methods

Event Date: 09-05-2014 16:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker(s): Giovanni Seni
## Title: Regularization in Regression and Deep Learning Methods
## Description:
### A widely held principle in statistical model inference is that accuracy and simplicity are both desirable. However, there is a trade-off between the two: a flexible (more complex) model is often needed to achieve higher accuracy, but it is more susceptible to overfitting and less likely to generalize well. Regularization techniques “damp down” the flexibility of a model fitting procedure by augmenting the error function with a term that penalizes model complexity. 

Minimizing the augmented error criterion requires a certain increase in accuracy to "pay" for the increase in model complexity (e.g., adding another term to the model). This session will offer a concise introduction to this topic and its application to linear regression and deep learning algorithms for neural networks.
