## Title: Real-World Sentiment Analysis with Big Data Tools
## Description:
### Sentiment analysis has become one of the most important tools marketing professionals can use to gauge consumer attitudes toward a brand, product, or overall marketing campaign. Understanding people’s attitudes can help companies develop and rethink their strategy in engaging with new and existing customers. 

Big data has democratized the ability to do sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, across much bigger data sets and a variety of data sources. It has also reduced the time-to-data, improving informed decision-making and uncovering time-sensitive opportunities.

In this session, we will explore the process of sentiment analysis and how big data tools can help. We’ll also walk through a live real-world sentiment analysis demo from social media to gauge the attitudes and opinions of PASS BA Conference attendees.

# Using Hive to Query and Process Big Data

## Speaker(s): Dan Clark
## Title: Using Hive to Query and Process Big Data
## Description:
### Writing Map-Reduce jobs to process data is not a trivial task. To be effective, you really need to be a seasoned Java or C# programmer. Even then, it’s a time-consuming experience. Say hello to Hive - a very useful tool for creating and running Map-Reduce jobs in Hadoop.

HiveQL is a declarative language modeled to provide a similar experience as writing SQL. If you are familiar with SQL, using HiveQL should be intuitive. With HiveQL, you construct and run the statement, submitting it to a query engine. The query engine then transforms the query into a series of Map-Reduce jobs. By not having to worry about the low-level coding, you become much more productive and can concentrate on data analysis.

This session, designed to get you up to speed and productive with Hive, includes several practical examples to make data analysis with Hive as concrete as possible.

## Description:
### Social media can be a bewildering stream of comments and content. But with better tools and a few key concepts from the social sciences, the flood of favorites, comments, tags, likes, ratings, and links can be brought into clearer focus to reveal key people, topics, and sub-communities.

Networks are a data structure commonly found across social media services that let you create collections of connections. The Social Media Research Foundation's free, open NodeXL project makes analysis of social media networks accessible to most Excel users. With NodeXL, networks become as easy to create as pie charts.
 
NodeXL supports the exploration of social media with import features that pull data from Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, and email networks. Come see how this tool lets you quickly generate useful network statistics and metrics and create visualizations of network graphs.

## Title: DAX from the Field: Real-World Case Studies
## Description:
### The Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formula language is still relatively new to many BI practitioners. But with more than 4 years under its belt now, it is proving its value every day – including in large installations that push the xVelocity in-memory engine to its limit. In this session, we will dive into lessons from the field, where real customers are using DAX to solve complex problems well beyond the Adventure Works scenarios.

How do you make a database fit in memory if it doesn’t fit? How do you handle billions of rows with a complex calculation? Can you perform reporting in any time zone, with time intelligence, efficiently? What tools can you use to benchmark and choose the right hardware? How do you scale up performance on both small and large databases? What are the common mistakes in DAX formulas that might cause performance bottlenecks?

These are just a few questions we will answer by looking at best practices that are working for real customers. Don’t miss this session if you want to learn efficient DAX solutions and how far you can push the limits of the system.

## Speaker(s): Peter Myers
## Title: Introduction to Time Series Forecasting
## Description:
### Imagine taking historical stock market data and using data science to more accurately predict future stock values. This is precisely the aim of the Microsoft Time Series data mining algorithm. Of course, your objective doesn't need to be personal profit to attend this session!

SQL Server Analysis Services includes the Microsoft Time Series algorithm to provide an approach to intuitive and accurate time series forecasting. The algorithm can be used in scenarios where you have a historic series of data and where you need to predict a future series of values based on more than just your gut instinct.

This session will describe how to prepare data, create and query time series data mining models, and interpret query results. Various demonstration data mining models will be created by using Visual Studio and, in self-service scenarios, by using the data mining add-ins available in Excel.

## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: Querying in DAX 
## Description:
### DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is not only an expression language but also a query language and, when it comes to performance, the xVelocity in-memory engine is second to none. Scanning fact tables and performing leaf-level computation happens in a matter of milliseconds. Nevertheless, as with any other language, you can write good DAX or bad DAX, depending on your understanding of the engine internals. 

This session will introduce DAX as a query language, showing the different ways of querying with DAX using real-world data. Some queries will be fast, others will need optimizations. Many practical examples based on common patterns and an analysis of the query plans will show how to get the best out of DAX.

## Speaker(s): Mark Davis
## Title: Big Data and the Challenge of Unstructured Information Analysis
## Description:
### Unstructured data has always posed a series of unique challenges for traditional methods of information management. Traditional data analysis techniques are of limited utility when approaching social media sentiment problems, or in trying to analyze customer relationship narratives, or in analyzing message traffic. The result is unanalyzed troves of data that have high relevance to organizational performance. 

In this session, we will discuss methods for unlocking insights from big data by acquiring and enriching the data using intelligent processes that scale over distributed computing infrastructure. Enrichment leads, in turn, to new opportunities for data engagement through interactive examination of big data.

## Speaker(s): Josh Fennessy
## Title: A Master Data Management Case Study: MDS and DQS
## Description:
### Master Data Management (MDM) is an integral part of any large data analytics project. Be it a corporate data warehouse, a departmental reporting solution, or an individual worksheet analysis, it is important that corporate data be accurate and consistent.
  
SQL Server 2012 includes two platforms to help implement and manage MDM solutions: Master Data Services (MDS) and Data Quality Services (DQS). MDS is used to create corporate data models and allows for storage, management, and versioning of important enterprise data. DQS can be used as a companion to MDS, ensuring that new data being imported into an analysis solution is being checked and validated against the enterprise data store.

In this session, you will gain a good understanding of MDS and DQS and learn how to implement a simple solution. We will also explore a case study of how to use MDS to manage corporate data using Excel. Finally, you will see how the ETL/ELT process can use DQS and MDS to ensure that data being loaded is correct and accurate.

## Speaker(s): Giovanni Seni
## Title: Regularization in Regression and Deep Learning Methods
## Description:
### A widely held principle in statistical model inference is that accuracy and simplicity are both desirable. However, there is a trade-off between the two: a flexible (more complex) model is often needed to achieve higher accuracy, but it is more susceptible to overfitting and less likely to generalize well. Regularization techniques “damp down” the flexibility of a model fitting procedure by augmenting the error function with a term that penalizes model complexity. 

Minimizing the augmented error criterion requires a certain increase in accuracy to "pay" for the increase in model complexity (e.g., adding another term to the model). This session will offer a concise introduction to this topic and its application to linear regression and deep learning algorithms for neural networks.

## Description:
### Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code. 

Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!
