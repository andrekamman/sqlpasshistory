# SQL Server 2012 Troubleshooting with Extended Events
#### [Back to calendar](#id-19)
Event Date: 02-10-2012 11:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration (DBA)
## Speaker(s): Klaus Aschenbrenner
## Title: SQL Server 2012 Troubleshooting with Extended Events
## Description:
### Extended Events is a new lightweight tracing infrastructure that Microsoft introduced first with SQL Server 2008. SQL Server 2012 provides you now also a very sophisticated UI for configuring event sessions based on Extended Events. In this session you will get a basic overview about Extended Events, what are they, how they are used inside SQL Server, and how you can use them to troubleshooting your SQL Server 2012 installation.

# Querying and Optimizing DAX 
#### [Back to calendar](#id-19)
Event Date: 02-10-2012 11:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence (BI)
## Speaker(s): Alberto Ferrari
## Title: Querying and Optimizing DAX 
## Description:
### In SQL 2012 DAX became a query language and, when it comes to performance, the xVelocity in-memory engine is second to none. Scanning fact tables and performing leaf-level computation happens in a matter of milliseconds. Nevertheless, as with any other language, you can write good DAX or bad DAX, depending on your understanding of the engine internals. In this session we are going to introduce DAX as a query language, showing the different ways of querying with DAX using real-world data. Some queries will be fast, others will need optimizations and a better understanding of query plans, which we will show, in order to give a complete understanding of how to get the best out of DAX.

# Deploying SQL Server 2012 Failover Clustering Instances
#### [Back to calendar](#id-19)
Event Date: 02-10-2012 13:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration (DBA)
## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: Deploying SQL Server 2012 Failover Clustering Instances
## Description:
### There are quite a few changes to failover clustering instances in SQL Server 2012, not the least of which is full multi-subnet support, the use of SMB shares, the ability to use a local tempdb, and more. Add to that mix the possibility of a new platform (Windows Server 2012), and there's a lot DBAs will need to know to update their skills to deploy clustered instances with the latest version of SQL Server. This session will cover the relevant tips, tricks, and gotchas including anything related to Windows Server 2012 if possible.

# ETL Frameworks with Dynamic SSIS Packages
#### [Back to calendar](#id-19)
Event Date: 02-10-2012 13:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence (BI)
## Speaker(s): Niko Neugebauer
## Title: ETL Frameworks with Dynamic SSIS Packages
## Description:
### In the ideal world, all information and structures are static, but in the real world almost everything is dynamic, and so many tables are affected by the changes of multiple applications and developers. 
If you have just a couple of objects to take care off, then it is all fine and easy to handle, but if you are working with 100's or 1000's of tables, will you try to edit all your SSIS packages manually? 

Join me to discover some ways to develop some simple ETL frameworks which can help handling some real world challenges, and learn how you can do some simple running without that much work. 
The only existing constant in the nature is the change, so we better be ready to face it.

# Indexing for Performance - What the Server Tells You
#### [Back to calendar](#id-19)
Event Date: 02-10-2012 13:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Development (DEV)
## Speaker(s): Mikael Wedham
## Title: Indexing for Performance - What the Server Tells You
## Description:
### You run queries every day. SQL Server says: "Here are yor results". Some people are good with that, but the server actually tells you much more. In this session we're going to learn the language of statistics and de-mystify the signs that execution plans in SQL Server uses to tell you what it did and why. We are also going to try to interpret the subtle signs into actual facts, where the server tells you: "I need this index, please". This session will teach you the why and how of the results.

Event Date: 02-10-2012 14:15 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Development (DEV)
## Speaker(s): Leonard Lobel
## Title: SQL Server Enterprise Data Management
## Description:
### SQL Server is readily equipped with three powerful features to help you manage data in your enterprise. Join Lenni in this triple-header, demo-packed session covering Change Data Capture (CDC), Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), and SQL Server Audit. With CDC, you can record changes in your database, without requiring any programming or resorting to triggers. Enabling TDE automatically encrypts the entire database in the background, without increasing database size, and without requiring any code. And with SQL Server Audit, virtually any action taken by any user can be recorded for auditing in either the file system or the Windows event log.

# xVelocity Under the Hood
#### [Back to calendar](#id-19)
Event Date: 02-10-2012 14:15 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence (BI)
## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: xVelocity Under the Hood
## Description:
### You run a DAX query, you get the result amazingly fast. But how did this happen? How does the xVelocity in-memory engine works, under the hood, to run queries so fast? In this session we will analyze the internals of the xVelocity engine, understanding the roles of Formula Engine and Storage Engine, how they interact and how queries are executed, with a particular interest on filter context and how it propagates through relationships. This knowledge can be important to understand how to get the best from the xVelocity engine by using the proper data model and DAX expressions.

# Automating DMV Performance Collection, Analysis and Archival
#### [Back to calendar](#id-19)
Event Date: 02-10-2012 14:15 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration (DBA)
## Speaker(s): Joe Chang
## Title: Automating DMV Performance Collection, Analysis and Archival
## Description:
### The SQL Server Dynamic Management Views and Functions are highly useful in providing quick access to available performance data without having to wait for a new trace. Collecting, analyzing and archiving DMV data through SQL scripts can be awkward and cumbersome. It is much more effective to do this in a proper programming language. Much of the tedious analysis work can be automated, but a quality assessment is still beyond the capability of hands-off tools.
Performance data can be collected at regular intervals and archived without much effort. When there is a significant performance degradation, the before and after execution plans are readily available. Performance problems are not difficult to resolve. But management may want an explanation, and are prone to issue edicts. So it is important that the correct information be presented.

# Optimising Column Stores with Statistical Analysis
#### [Back to calendar](#id-19)
Event Date: 03-10-2012 10:15 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration (DBA)
## Speaker(s): Thomas Kejser
## Title: Optimising Column Stores with Statistical Analysis
## Description:
### You may already know that ordering the records in a table before you add a column store index may increase compression. And if you don't, I will show you just how it does to get us on the same page.

But the real question is: WHICH order of the column is the right one?

In this session, I will walk you through some basic statistical entropy analysis to discover the near optimal sorting of data. This will increase compression (And speed) of column stores. I will use anonymised datasets from real customer data to prove my points.

As a side effect of the analysis we will do together, it is also possible to discover missing multi-column statistics on a table. Using this new knowledge, we will be able to add new statistics to the database table to increase the likelihood of getting good query plans.

## Speaker(s): Alexei Khalyako
## Title: SQLCAT - Data Movement Considerations for the Hybrid Solutions between Cloud and on-Premise
## Description:
### There is a lot of excitement around moving parts of the business workload into the Cloud.  One of the most interesting approaches is to build combined solutions where the ‘traditional’   SQL and Cloud services could be combined together in so called ‘Hybrid’ configuration. The question we want to discuss is: we know how to get data into the SQL Server quick and efficiently. Will those techniques also work  when moving data into the Cloud? Please join the session to learn about our observations when we applied the data loading best practices to the Hybrid solutions and the best practices we identified for the Hybrid configurations.

### User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus?
The reason is performance. In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.
However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of SQL Server and still get good performance.

## Title: A Dive into Data Quality Services SQL Server 2012
## Description:
### Data quality and data cleansing have always been major challenges to any enterprise that deals with data. For those of us who have dealt with Data Profiler Tasks in SQL Server 2008, we were shocked yet pleasantly surprised with the great advances that Microsoft has made with the advent of Data Quality Services, in the SQL Server 2012 release. In this hands-on presentation we shall be looking at how to set up a new knowledge base, based upon an existing one, set up rules, do knowledge discovery within the new knowledge base and finally cleanse the data through a data quality project. The end results being more effective data, guaranteed to keep end users and management happy.
