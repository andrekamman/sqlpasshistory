# Performance Troubleshooting Using Waits and Latches
#### [Back to calendar](#id-30)
Event Date: 03-11-2014 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Paul Randal
## Title: Performance Troubleshooting Using Waits and Latches
## Description:
### One of the first things you should check when investigating performance issues are wait and latch statistics, as these can often point you in the right direction for further analysis. Unfortunately, many people misinterpret what SQL Server is telling them and jump to conclusions about how to solve the problem: what is often called 'knee-jerk performance tuning'. 

In this full-day pre-conference session, you'll learn how to investigate and interpret wait and latch statistics and learn practical techniques you can take home and start using immediately. You'll also learn what a myriad of wait and latch types actually mean and how you can investigate lightly-documented types to gain insight into what causes them. 

Don't waste time when it comes to performance troubleshooting; wait statistics are the fastest route to understanding your problems and this workshop will help you get there faster.

Event Date: 03-11-2014 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Adam Jorgensen, John Welch
## Title: Big Data: Deploy, Design, and Manage Like a Pro
## Description:
### Attendees will leave with a live-deployed Hadoop environment they can take back to their company and begin using! This session covers the basics, but quickly goes beyond to a hands-on scenario based approach covering something for all attendees. We will be discussing deployment models, best practices, administration and configuration patterns, and more! 

We will do this through a series of labs that the audience can follow along with. These labs and demos will showcase how to make big data real for the enterprise. That means something for the architects with on-demand compute and analysis, something for operations with real time operational streaming and analytics, predictive analytics for the analysts and development, and BI integration for the data developers.

Each student will build a new environment setting up these scenarios so they can take the examples back to their own firm and use them the next day. This is a real development and architecture coaching and training session that will leave attendees excited about all that these technologies can do to modernize their data architecture. 

We will also provide coverage of new innovation areas such as Stinger, Spark, and other new technologies that make this ecosystem more valuable to the modern data professional.

# Zero to Hero with PowerShell and SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#id-30)
Event Date: 03-11-2014 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Robert Cain, Bradley Ball, Jason Strate
## Title: Zero to Hero with PowerShell and SQL Server
## Description:
### There are two kinds of people in the SQL Server world: those who are using PowerShell, and those who will be. In this full-day pre-conference session, you'll learn how to become one of the "cool kids" using PowerShell. 

The day will start with an introduction to PowerShell, basic useage, and cmdlets. Next, we'll dive into programming scripts in PowerShell, starting with the basics of loops, conditional logic, and functions, and moving right along to creating your own reusable modules. The real meat of the day comes when we learn how to interact with SQL Server from PowerShell. 

Both the SQL Provider and SMO (SQL Management Objects) DLL library will be covered in full. Most importantly, you'll learn how to read the online SMO library documentation and how to convert the examples into PowerShell syntax. 

The day will culminate by building a reusable module for working with many SQL Server common tasks, such as T-SQL code generation, or performing health checks on your servers. Don't be left behind! Learn how to leverage the power of PowerShell in your SQL Server environment.

# In-Memory OLTP Internals: How is a 30x Performance Boost Possible?
#### [Back to calendar](#id-30)
Event Date: 03-11-2014 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: In-Memory OLTP Internals: How is a 30x Performance Boost Possible?
## Description:
### SQL Server In-Memory OLTP (code name: Hekaton) is Microsoft’s new technology being shipped as part of SQL Server 2014 which will completely change the way you think about concurrency and data management. Concurrency problems are one of the top three performance issues that all applications have to deal with. 

In this full-day seminar, Kalen Delaney (a SQL Server MVP for over 20 years) will show you how SQL Server 2012 manages concurrent operations to understand where there is room for improvement. We’ll look at the completely new data structures for In-Memory OLTP to see how SQL Server 2014 can provide lock-free and latch-free data processing. 

This session we’ll discuss what gets written to disk during checkpoints, as well as what gets logged. Kalen will explain how the recovery process recreates your memory-optimized tables. Finally, she’ll go into detail on just what it is that makes In-Memory OLTP so much FASTER!

# Mastering T-SQL Querying Fundamentals
#### [Back to calendar](#id-30)
Event Date: 03-11-2014 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Itzik Ben-Gan
## Title: Mastering T-SQL Querying Fundamentals
## Description:
### T-SQL was named the most popular programming language in 2013. If you work with SQL Server in any capacity, as a developer, DBA, BI specialist, analyst, power user, you need to know your T-SQL. The thing is, this language is deceptive. When you start learning it you quickly get to write queries with filters, sorting, grouping, joining, and so on. You might get a false sense of confidence and the wrong impression that the language is easy to master. In reality, most get to learn T-SQL without understanding the fundamentals correctly, and this incorrect understanding can lead to using the language incorrectly. Often people assume things about the language that are not guaranteed, and end up with bugs in their code.

This full-day seminar is dedicated to correct understanding of T-SQL querying fundamentals. You will learn about the principal elements in the foundations of the language. You will learn about logical query processing—what I find to be the most critical aspect of T-SQL that any T-SQL practitioner should master. Then the seminar covers fundamentals of query constructs like joins, subqueries, table expressions (derived tables, CTEs, views, table valued functions), the APPLY operator, and set operators. If time will permit, the seminar will also cover the fundamentals of more specialized query constructs like PIVOT, UNPIVOT, grouping sets and window functions.

Know your T-SQL querying fundamentals well, and then tackling advanced problems will be so much easier.

## Speaker(s): Chris Shaw, John Morehouse
## Title: Real World End-to-End Performance Solutions
## Description:
### Do you ever wonder how other people approach real world business objectives from start to finish? The success of a project can be hampered from decisions that are made before a single row resides in a database, and yet often there is no one single best solution, because different people will approach a problem from different angles and there are countless variables along the path that are critical to success. If you make a mistake at the beginning, costly redesigns may haunt you for years to come.  

In this powerful yet entertaining full-day pre-conference session, we will start with two different database professionals with two different skill sets. The speakers both have very different ways of approaching a project (and are both set in their ways!), but both have the same measurable goal. Whose process runs faster? Join this session and see the results.

In other words . . . “Let’s get ready to Rumble!”

What may appear as the end of the session is really only the beginning as variables and limitations are added and various questions are answered: What happens to our project when we are forced to use GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers), or when we push our solution to the cloud? Does the introduction of new hardware improve the overall outcome of our test? Do we see faster performance with SQL Server 2014 over SQL Server 2012? Join us and find out!

# Data Modeling in SSAS Tabular
#### [Back to calendar](#id-30)
Event Date: 03-11-2014 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: Data Modeling in SSAS Tabular
## Description:
### Analysis Services offers two different types of modeling: Tabular and Multidimensional. The Multidimensional model is based on the OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) engine and the MDX (MultiDimensional eXpressions) language. The Tabular model was introduced in 2012 and is based on the DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) language and on a fast in-memory engine called VertiPaq, which provides state-of-the art compression algorithms and query performance.
This full-day pre-conference session is dedicated to Tabular Modeling in Analysis Services 2012 and is the best way to learn this new technology directly from two SSAS Maestros who have used the product since the early beta releases, and who have written a book and many articles on this topic. No knowledge of previous versions of Analysis Services and UDM (Unified Dimensional Model) is required, because Tabular is based on different concepts and on the new DAX language. As an attendee, you will learn the best practices of creating Tabular data models by using the right techniques to design entities and relationships of the business model, optimizing the memory consumption, as well as the performance.

This full-day session will also cover features that affect presentation (hierarchies, table and column properties, formatting) and topics related to deployment, security, and partitioning.

## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: The A to Z of Availability Groups
## Description:
### Ever since it was introduced in SQL Server 2012, Availability Groups (AGs) have been a source of interest, curiosity, and confusion. We’ve hit a point where many are seriously evaluating and looking to deploy AGs, but they are deceptively easy to deploy. While AGs share some common traits with both database mirroring and clustered instances of SQL Server (FCIs), the feature is its own entity. This full-day pre-conference session will focus on getting you up to speed with AGs in SQL Server 2012 and 2014. Some of the major topics include:
•         The real difference between FCIs and AGs – one of the sources of      confusion since they both use an underlying Windows Server failover cluster (WSFC)
•         Planning a WSFC for an AG deployment, including things like networking             and hybrid scenarios that involve the cloud
•         WSFC quorum for AGs
•         Failure scenarios and how to recover from them 
•         Tips, tricks, and best practices for deploying AGs and their administration

## Title: Better Performance through Parallelism
## Description:
### Today's server hardware ships with a truly massive amount of CPU power. And while SQL Server is designed to automatically and seamlessly take advantage of available processing resources, there are a number of options, settings, and patterns that can be exploited to optimize parallel processing of your data. 

This full-day pre-conference session starts with an overview of CPU scheduler internals from the perspective of both Windows and the SQL Server Operating System (SQLOS). Next, you will learn about intra-query parallelism, the method that SQL Server uses to break up large tasks into many smaller pieces, so that each piece can be processed simultaneously. You will come to understand how to read parallel query plans and how to interpret parallel wait statistics, as well as best practices for the various parallelism settings within SQL Server. Finally, you will be introduced to techniques for exploiting parallelism at the query level: patterns that can help the optimizer do a better job of parallelizing your query. 

After attending this pre-conference session, you will be in full control of your CPUs and be able to compel your server to use every clock tick to your end users' advantage.

## Speaker(s): Kevin Kline
## Title: Top 10 Mistakes of New IT Leaders
## Description:
### The IT industry is a growth industry employing millions of workers in all industries and regions of the USA. This perennial shortage of IT experienced workers, added to IT career paths which hit a salary plateau for those who stay purely technical, means it’s very common for a talented IT pro to move into leadership and management positions. Unfortunately, the skills that made you a successful individual contributor on an IT team don’t translate into the skills needed to be a strong leader or manager. This session delves into a variety of common mistakes among new IT leaders, such as:

1.	How does accepting the status quo limit productivity and inhibit innovation?
2.	What does an uncommunicative leader express to their team and superiors?
3.	Why is goal setting such an important part of leadership?

## Speaker(s): Dan Bulos
## Title: Are You Getting Your Message Across? How to Display Data!
## Description:
### There are many books and articles on how to design a dashboard or create a pretty chart. But how do you know which graphical representation is the right one for your data? What kind of chart will give you the insights into the data you are looking for? When should you use multiple series on a chart versus using small multiples? What is the best way to show contribution to the whole?  Why would you mix a line and bar chart?  

This session will answer these questions by taking a case study approach. Different data sets will be studied and we will see how different charts bring out different aspects of the data. Perhaps more importantly, we will take a look at which charts don’t really show anything interesting at all. Time will also be spent looking at the differences between using charts in reports and dashboards as opposed to visual analytics.

## Title: Dealing with Multipurpose Procs and PSP the RIGHT Way!
## Description:
### What is parameter sniffing? When does it occur and when does it become a problem (a.k.a. parameter sniffing problem / PSP)? How can you simplify your procedure creation strategies to create procedures that recompile “enough” – not too much or not enough? Wait, isn't recompilation bad? 

Come to this session to learn when recompilation is warranted. And, more importantly, how to choose to do it selectively and only for the combinations of parameters that really need it. Create the right balance of CPU / recompilation with a programming strategy that also simplifies the overall number of procedures needed.

## Speaker(s): Chris Shaw
## Title: Schema/Data Modifications: Something's Changed? We'll Find it
## Description:
### How often is your morning routine interrupted with frantic phone calls blaming the database for performance issues that were not there the day before? Logic tells you something has changed, yet no one claims the responsibility. If the organization’s default reaction to issues includes scrutinizing the DBA, then it’s time to talk about baselines.    

A baseline is often determined to be complete after a number of Performance Monitor data collections, but that’s only the beginning. When the only information available to you are performance counters, how can you determine if there have been changes to the code, or changes to the hardware and configuration? When you alter the way you watch your systems, you increase your ability to solve problems quicker and you also increase the resiliency. 

In this session, we’ll look at the tools Microsoft has built a solid baseline for SQL Server 2008 to SQL Server 2014.

## Description:
### So far, we've been able to create Power View reports against data models in Excel workbooks and against Analysis Services tabular models. But what if you want to create one against an existing Analysis Services multidimensional model—that is, against a cube? Now you can. In this session, learn what you need, what's supported, and how it works. See some new Power View features to handle various cube features, such as display folders, default members, cell-level number and currency formatting, and more. But wait, there's more: a couple of bonus Power View features!

## Speaker(s): Oliver Engels, Tillmann Eitelberg
## Title: SSIS and HDInsight
## Description:
### Microsoft HDInsight provides a 100-percent Apache Hadoop solution in the cloud. With HDInsight, you have a cloud-based big data platform that can manage the data of any type and any size, whether structured or unstructured. While petabytes of unstructured data can be processed in a few hours with Hadoop, SQL Server can process terabytes of structured data in a few seconds. What could be better than to connect both worlds and transfer data between HDInsight and SQL Server?

With the SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) - since included in SQL Server 2005 - and known as high-performance ETL platform, Microsoft also provides at first glance the ideal platform for this. But is that really the case? How does SSIS metadata and unstructured data get together? In this session, we show how SSIS and HDInsight can work together, as well as how Hadoop jobs can be executed and how data can be transferred with SSIS between HDInsight, SQL Server, and other sources or destinations.

## Speaker(s): Jonathan Kehayias
## Title: Solving Complex Problems with Extended Events
## Description:
### Diagnosing problems with SQL Server can be tough, and there are a lot tools to choose from to collect the necessary information to pinpoint the root cause of a problem. This session will show you how to leverage Extended Events (XE) to look at what occurs inside of SQL Server to facilitate faster identification of complex problems based on real world scenarios and the new buffer pool extension and in-memory table features of SQL Server 2014. 

Introduced in SQL Server 2008, Extended Events provides a refreshingly new method of looking at what occurs inside of SQL Server. The expansion of the number of events in SQL Server 2012 made Extended Events a viable replacement for SQL Trace with minimal performance impacts on even the busiest systems. At some point everyone will need to understand how to leverage Extended Events, and this session will get you started on the path to success.

## Speaker(s): MIKE DONNELLY
## Title: Twice in a Lifetime: T-SQL Refactoring 101
## Description:
### Whether it’s because you inherited the code from the “last guy,” or your stored procedures haven’t been looked at since the database was created in 2001, there will come a time when you need to rewrite old code. When you start this project you may ask yourself, how did I get here? And you may ask yourself, how do I work this? This is not my beautiful database. This is not my beautiful T-SQL. Letting the data go by, information flowing to the end users is the goal. Refactoring old code can be tedious, but necessary. Sometimes it isn’t just about identifying the worst queries in your application, but figuring out how to rewrite everything to introduce the best practices that the last guy didn't know about five years ago. 

This session will cover ways to quickly find old T-SQL antipatterns, tools that can help make things easier to update code, and deprecated features that can’t be used in modern versions of SQL Server. Don't leave your old T-SQL the same as it ever was.

You must attend both sessions to get the most out of this talk as it is “one talk”) covers the internals of how the SQL Server Engine reads and writes data to/from data and transaction log storage. 

The approach of this talk is to look at the “basic lifecycle” of I/O for database in SQL Server from creating a database, reading database pages, writing to the transaction log, and writing database pages to disk. Behind this approach I will weave in how SQLOS is involved in I/O, Windows APIs, background processes (Ex. checkpoint), monitoring tools, diagnostics tools, error conditions, troubleshooting, trace flags, and more.

In addition the following topics will be covered as they relate to I/O:

•	Building Indexes
•	Altering Databases
•	Backup/Restore Basics
•	DBCC
•	Reading the transaction log
•	Tempdb
•	Resource Governor
•	Shutting down
•	Cloud Hybrid I/O Scenarios
•	Hekaton

Come ready to learn and have your brain melted in this fast-paced, fact-filled, and very deep session. This is a 500+ level session and is not for everyone. As with all my “Inside” talks, I will use the Windows Debugger and other tools, have lots of demos, and often talk about Windows APIs. However, even though this is a deep session for folks who love internals, I do present practical information that can help you make informed decisions about the configuration, deployment, maintenance, and operations for your SQL Server with respect to I/O. Even though much of the information I present can apply to older versions of SQL Server, all materials will be presented will be based on the internals of SQL Server 2012 and SQL Server 2014.

## Speaker(s): Pat Sinthusan
## Title: SQL Server 2014: The Cure for Cloud Phobia
## Description:
### With all of the real and/or perceived value that cloud computing brings, database systems have been one of the last workloads to really take advantage of what the cloud has to offer. Control, compliance, security and mobility concerns have prompted DBAs to hold off on considering cloud-based scenarios. The good news is that there are hybrid scenarios that allow you to leverage cloud computing services while retaining full control and mobility of your enterprise data. 

In this session, you will learn how to build an agile storage infrastructure that balances private and cloud resources to optimize SQL Server 2014.

## Speaker(s): Rafael Salas
## Title: Power Query: Business Users and ETL Developers Hug Day
## Description:
### Due to its complexity and rigid development cycles, traditional ETL processes are a costly element of information centric solutions. In many cases, end users grow in frustration as they are forced to wait for IT teams they know are "too slow,” and processes that "miss the mark." Meanwhile, IT is battling what they perceive as an "unreasonable" number of requests coming from business users. IT and business don't look each other in the eye anymore.

This session will help address those concerns. You will learn how Power Query can be easily used to empower business users when discovering, combining, refining and publishing data while allowing IT to leverage self-service tools that fit in their overall architecture portfolio. We will use Power Query to show how business users can solve complex data integration challenges that traditionally rely on IT driven technologies in a way that is intuitive and effective. As a bonus, you may get a free hug from a developer or an end user.

## Speaker(s): Matt Smith, Michael Wilmot
## Title: Real World Healthcare BI Transformations in the Cloud
## Description:
### Last evening Dr. Barto had an idea on the plane that he wanted to investigate.  He was looking for patterns in Drug usage and disease track for his Clinical trial session in the morning.  He logged into his hosted portal in O365 and asked some questions to the historical data his facility has stored in the cloud and surfaced through Power BI.  He also saw a report that he liked and posts some questions through Yammer.  He captured a graph in one of his presentations for Wednesday and sent a note to his analyst Matt Smith to asked for him to check the hypothesis he has arrived at. Matt quickly identifies the appropriate data source that supports Dr. Barto's hypothesis, adds it to the data model Dr. Barto is using and sets him up to speak to these results in his Clinical Trial session via Lync. Dr. Barto delivered a successful data supported session to his peers and has transformed how, when, and what drug treatments are used for in-patient and post operation disease procedures.

## Speaker(s): Jason Thomas
## Title: DataViz You Thought You Could NOT Do with SSRS
## Description:
### Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!

Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code.

# Autogenerate a Dimensional Data Warehouse from Metadata
#### [Back to calendar](#id-30)
Event Date: 06-11-2014 16:45 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Scott Currie
## Title: Autogenerate a Dimensional Data Warehouse from Metadata
## Description:
### Most data warehouse design efforts produce a large amount of metadata in the form of handwritten documentation. If done properly, this documentation provides everything the development team requires to build the dimensional data model and load that model with transformed data using the patterns and best practices that were also specified as part of the warehouse design. Unfortunately, the process of translating requirements to T-SQL scripts and SSIS packages requires tremendous effort and creates assets that are expensive to maintain.  

In this session, we will show how to instead use a metadata database to store the requirements information, and then use this metadata to automatically generate EVERYTHING you need for your data warehouse project: documentation, schemas, SSIS packages, deployment scripts, etc. The code for the solution, which is presently in use in production data warehouses in major international companies, will be provided for all attendees to freely use.

## Speaker(s): Erin Stellato
## Title: Five Execution Plan Patterns to Watch for
## Description:
### There's a lot of information in a query plan, and understanding how to leverage it when performance tuning is a valuable skill. Throw in issues such as cardinality, data structures, and residual predicates, and suddenly the volume of what you need to know can become tricky to step through and effectively tune queries.  

In this session, Erin Stellato will show you how to focus on particular patterns you can apply that take the guessing out of plan-based tuning. There are good things to look for, as well as bad, and these patterns will help you develop a methodology to accelerate both your confidence with reading plans and the performance of your queries.

## Title: Visual Analytics with HDInsight and Power View
## Description:
### BIG DATA!  There, I've said it.  But, what exactly does it mean for YOU?

This session will help to dispel some of the big data confusion, and we will focus on HD Insight, Microsoft's Hadoop based implementation. Loading data and querying a database is one thing and that will certainly be covered. Exploring how we can integrate data from HD Insight into our existing analytic solutions is one of the real world implementations this session will be focused on. This is one of the keys to successfully selling management on the needs for a big data solution. It's not just another database, it's a tool to enhance existing analytic structures.

During this session, we'll start with a brief overview of Hadoop and HDFS. Next, we'll take a look at HD Insight, and explore some of the features therein.

Finally, integration with SSAS and Power View (using Excel 2013) will be shown, which will close the loop on big data visualizations.

## Title: Table Partitioning: the Secret Weapon for Your Big Data Problems
## Description:
### Is big data starting to slow you down? Is data growth putting your maintenance tasks in danger of not meeting your service level agreements? Do you wish you could archive old data with minimal impact to your tables during the archive process? Do you wish you could eliminate the majority of the data in your tables when you query them? If so, its time you consider implementing table partitioning to help with your general performance and to reduce your maintenance window for completing your maintenance tasks. 

In this session, you will learn how table partitioning works and when it should be implemented. You will be able to understand how to initially configure partition functions and partition schemes to have a rock solid partitioned table. You learn how to implement new features added in SQL Server 2014 to improve table partitioning.  Finally, you will learn how to implement an automated sliding window to maintain your partitioned tables for ensuring optimal performance.

## Speaker(s): Jos de Bruijn
## Title: SQL Server 2014 In-Memory OLTP Transaction Processing
## Description:
### In-Memory OLTP introduces a new optimistic multi-versioned concurrency control (MVCC) model for memory-optimized tables that is lock-free and supports the isolation levels SNAPSHOT, REPEATABLE READ, and SERIALIZABLE. We explain how SQL Server achieves these isolation levels without taking locks. We will look at the innards of In-Memory OLTP transactions, and touch on concepts such as transaction validation, commit dependencies, and the read-, write-, and scan-sets. Finally, we see how SQL Server can guarantee transaction isolation for mixed transaction that use locking/blocking for disk-based table and optimistic MVCC for memory-optimized tables.

## Speaker(s): Dejan Sarka
## Title: Identity Mapping and De-Duplicating 
## Description:
### In an enterprise, merging master data, like customer data, from multiple sources is a common problem. Typically, you do not have a single, i.e. the same key identifying a customer in different sources and you have to match data based on similarity of strings, like names and addresses. 

In this session, we are going to check how different algorithms for comparing strings included in SQL Server 2012 and SQL Server 2014 work. We are going to use Soundex Transact-SQL function, four different algorithms that come with Master Data Services (Levenshtein, Jaccard, Jaro-Winkler and Ratcliff-Obershelp), and Fuzzy Lookup transformation from Integration Services. 

Finally, we are going to introduce how SQL Server 2012 Data Quality Services (DQS) help us here. We are also going to tackle the performance problems with string matching merging.

## Speaker(s): Paul Rizza
## Title: Shortcuts to SSIS via C#.Net - EzAPI
## Description:
### SSIS developers are often asked to build hundreds of packages with the same basic layout but targeting different tables (and therefore different metadata on the columns needed to be moved).  Many people would love to use the SSIS API and C# but find the overall effort is too complex for anyone but senior C# programmers and therefore the SSIS Developer often has a team of jr developers create the packages one at a time in SSDT.  

This course will show how someone with basic programming skills can leverage EzAPI to develop those same packages programmatically in minutes with fewer than 50 lines of code.  

Demos scripts will cover creating 300+ packages in under 5 minutes or dynamically building out the load packages to populate a Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension in hours instead of weeks.

## Speaker(s): Luke Jian
## Title: A Tale of Two Joins: Merge vs. Hash
## Description:
### A good understanding of join algorithms is essential in diagnosing and fixing issues related to bad query plans. However, one of today’s realities is that a lot of database professionals do not have a computer science degree and didn’t sit through a formal “Introduction to Relational Databases” course. 

This session seeks to fill in some of the gaps that might exist by looking in-depth at the three types of join operations. We’ll visualize how the join operations’ algorithms work so you can understand how query plans are computed, and then we’ll look at why these join operations have very different performance characteristics and why the optimizer chooses a specific join operator to use in a query plan. You’ll see through demonstrations that empirical cost calculations are similar to what the query optimizer actually returns.

## Speaker(s): Kevin Hazzard
## Title: Using the Resource Governor for Scalability
## Description:
### SQL Server's Resource Governor is a highly underutilized tool in the DBA's toolbox. Many SQL administrators don't even know it exists. Used correctly, the Resource Governor can enhance the scalability of your databases by helping you to define and implement business rules that more fairly allocate your memory, CPU and I/O resources to users. Used incorrectly, the Resource Governor can lead to more problems than it solves. 

In this highly-interactive, demo-focused session, the presenter will guide you through several real-world examples that show how the Resource Governor should be used and a couple of examples that show the opposite. Please join us for a fun- and fact-filled whirlwind tour of the resource management tools built right into SQL Server.

## Speaker(s): Mark Broadbent
## Title: Enter the Dragon: Running SQL 2014 on Windows Server Core
## Description:
### In 1982, the Dragon32 entered the home computer market but unfortunately there was one small problem: lower-case letters were almost impossible to access. Two years later, Dragon was no more. In 2008, Microsoft released ServerCore providing a fast and streamlined (but reduced functionality) edition of Windows with minimal GUI support and with Windows 2012/R2 Server Core is "by default.” Ever since SQL 2012, installation onto Server Core became a "supported" option and meant the single biggest administrative shift for a DBA since the release of SQL 2005 . . . or did it?

In this exciting session, we will discuss administration, configuration, and installation of both SQL 2014 and ServerCore in both standalone and advanced AlwaysOn configurations. But will the lack of GUI support send Server Core in the same direction as the Dragon32, or spell a bright new beginning for Server based computing and SQL Server? Join this session to find out, and, this time, listen to the Dragon roar!

This session will show how Power Query can be easily used to take advantage of data's properties to drive the change we need to support our goals.

We will discuss/demonstrate:
-- The simple process of accessing a wide variety of data sources
-- The ease with which simple transformations can be achieved using the Power Query Ribbon
-- Power Query's fantastic ability to travel through time to see every step taken with the data
-- The foundations of the Power Query Formula Language, informally know as "M"
-- Using "M" to take Power Query WAY beyond what the Ribbon has to offer.

Come learn about what may well be the most exciting member of the Power BI family.

## Description:
### A common use case in many databases is a very large table, which serves as some kind of activity log, with an ever increasing date/time column. This table is usually partitioned, and it suffers from heavy load of reads and writes. Such a table presents a challenge in terms of maintenance and performance. Activities such as loading data into the table, querying the table, rebuilding indexes or updating statistics become quite challenging.

SQL Server 2014 offers several new features that can make all these challenges go away. In this session, we will analyze a use case involving such a large table. We will examine features such as Incremental Statistics, New Cardinality Estimation, and Delayed Durability, and we will apply them on our challenging table and see what happens.

## Title: Administering and Managing the Power BI Environment
## Description:
### Power BI for Office 365 is Microsoft's new self-service BI offering. Just because it emphasizes self-service doesn't mean a system administrator isn't an important role!

In this session, we will discuss the overall system components and how a Power BI site in SharePoint Online differs from an on-premises SharePoint BI site. We will walk through how to best handle setting up connectivity to data sources, when a gateway is needed, and what data refresh capabilities exist. We will also consider how and when to create OData feeds from your corporate on-premises data sources and how those OData feeds affect Enterprise Data Search functionality.

## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: T-SQL User-Defined Functions, or: Bad Performance Made Easy
## Description:
### User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus? The reason is performance.

In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.

However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of code encapsulation and reuse, and still get good performance.

## Speaker(s): Pam Lahoud
## Title: Built for Speed: Database Application Design for Performance
## Description:
### Performance tuning: it's not just for DBAs!  Many design decisions that are made early in the application lifecycle can have a dramatic impact on performance later on.  Once an application is in production, correcting these issues may be time-consuming or even impossible without a complete re-write!  In this session, we learn some of the considerations that you the developer should keep in mind when designing a new database application.  Learn how things like choice of data type, caching, looping etc. can affect the performance of your application before you even write your first query.

# A New Approach to Unit Testing and Integration Testing in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#id-30)
Event Date: 07-11-2014 16:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Julie Smith, Scott Currie
## Title: A New Approach to Unit Testing and Integration Testing in SSIS
## Description:
### Testing is critical to managing a high-quality data lifecycle. Unfortunately, SSIS has no built-in support for test authoring and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered.  

In this session, a new approach to unit testing (focusing on verifying the correctness of individual packages, tasks, or dataflows) and integration testing (focusing on validating that the data produced by an entire sequence of transformations) will be discussed. This approach uses metadata authored by analysts in Excel to automatically generate testing logic within the corresponding packages or to automatically generate standalone test packages that contain all of the necessary validation logic. All code will be shared with attendees for free and unrestricted use within their own projects.

## Speaker(s): Michael Frandsen
## Title: High Performance Infrastructure for SQL Server 2014
## Description:
### Since SQL Server 2012 came out, a paradigm shift has occurred in how SQL Server platforms are designed and built. Come and hear why you will no longer need a SAN to create a high-available SQL Server and why I/O is no longer a problem.

In this session, we will discuss the new storage features in Windows Server 2012 and R2 and how they relate to SQL Server 2012 and how SQL Server 2014 expands on this.

In working with the Core Windows Server team in Redmond during the development of Windows 8/2012 and 8.1/R2, the presenter did a lot of work with technologies which have been around for some time, but unavailable to Windows Server installations. We will talk about InfiniBand, SMB, Multi-path I/O, RDMA, RoCE, NAND Flash storage, latency and much more.

Having worked on the development of SQL Server 2014 and Win8.1, the speaker will share completely new concepts of integration between SQL Server and modern hardware.

## Speaker(s): John Stuchly
## Title: Poor Man's Dashboard:  Modular Dashboard Design in SSRS
## Description:
### While a tool designed around dashboarding concepts that provides significant interaction is desirable, it can be a tough sell until the value is recognized. This session demonstrates how to introduce the benefits of dashboarding using your existing SSRS investment.  

The concept was designed and delivered as an operational dashboard to an executive team, and displayed both on desktop monitors and 50' screens for continual business monitoring. We will show the creation of a dashboarding template, or canvas, which is the framework for delivery. We will then create multiple data sources, spanning relational, multidimensional, and SharePoint lists, which will be used to populate our widgets. 

We’ll create a drill report to provide interactivity to the dashboard, and dataset scheduling and autorefresh options will be covered as well. We will bring it all together and present an effective dashboard and have a modular process for creating additional dashboards and shared widgets.
