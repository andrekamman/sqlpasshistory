## Title: Predictive Analytics in the Enterprise
## Description:
### Data science is a booming field, but what does that mean for SQL Server DBAs, developers and managers? To get started in this area, the data mining algorithms in Analysis Services provide capabilities to help you achieve predictive analytics success with your SQL Server data, and any other data you have access to.  

In this session, we’ll cover the predictive analytics process from beginning to end, and by the end of the day you’ll have a practical understanding of how to develop predictive models for your data. 

The session includes an overview of predictive modeling concepts and terminology, followed by the opportunity for you to complete actual predictive modeling exercises throughout the day using Excel and Visual Studio. You’ll see how to fine-tune and compare results using various algorithms, and how to make the best use of the models within your enterprise. 

The session also provides brief coverage of popular data mining alternatives to understand what Microsoft provides in comparison with tools such as R, Python, and Weka.  

Session Outline

- Overview of predictive modeling concepts and terminology
- Learn what SQL Server data mining and the Microsoft eco-system provides
- Case studies presented from actual predictive analytics projects
- Understand tools and algorithms for predictive modeling
- Demonstrations of predictive model development
- Classroom exercises allowing attendees to develop their own models
- Learn how models are used with DMX in C#, SSIS, SSRS

## Speaker(s): Tim Chapman, Denzil Ribeiro
## Title: Troubleshoot Customer Performance Problems Like a Microsoft Engineer
## Description:
### Performance troubleshooting is arguably one of the most difficult aspects of being a database professional. Hardware and software continually get better, but data size and complexity continues to grow at an exponential rate. As Microsoft SQL field engineers, we service the largest customers in the world and see, troubleshoot, and fix challenging performance problems.  
 
In this full-day session join two SQL Server Microsoft Certified Masters, Principal PFE Denzil Ribeiro and Senior PFE Tim Chapman, as they tackle various challenging customer scenarios they've encountered. The class will start with developing a general performance troubleshooting methodology, which will include topics such as wait statistics, extended events, perfmon, DMVs, pssdiag, SQL Nexus. The rest of the day will cover hands-on troubleshooting of real performance problems. Customer problems will be reproduced and you will be involved in solving them , so expect an interactive class! Scenarios will relate to SQL Server 2008 - 2012 including how some of these are alleviated in SQL 2014.

## Title: Superhero Power BI
## Description:
### Personal, heroic deeds, and the right gadgets are the making of a true superhero. In this day-long pre-conference session, learn how Power BI can enable the superhero in you to thwart evil deeds - aka "no data", "old data," and the all-too-common "incomplete data."

The aim of this session is to excite you with the potential of Microsoft's new self-service suite of BI products and collaboration platform, called Power BI. You will learn about four “Power” authoring products available in Excel and how they function to discover, acquire, transform, relate, and enrich data for analysis and reporting. Topics include Power Query, PowerPivot, Power View, and Power Map.

You will also learn how to effectively share and collaborate on Power BI solutions in the cloud with Office 365. Topics include data refresh to on-premise data, the data catalog to search for data queries, natural language query (Q&A) to intuitively query data, and a mobile application for Power BI.

This session has been designed to provide perspective across the Power BI story. Theory and an end-to-end series of real-world demonstrations will allow you to appreciate how the Power BI products span on-premise and cloud environments and how they attain super-strength as they work together.

## Title: Microsoft Azure SQL Database – Resource Management
## Description:
### Azure SQL Database is a relational database-as-a-service that delivers predictable performance, scalability, business continuity and data protection for cloud developers. Azure SQL Database service is built on shared resources from thousands of physical machines. Each physical machine host many databases; availability and performance for each database can vary based on other activities on the physical machine. Azure SQL Database uses some techniques to manage resources and provide a stable system with optimal usage of physical servers.
In this session, we will go over the architecture and internals of Azure SQL Database and then focus on resource management techniques incluload balancing, engine throttling, using resource governor to isolate load on physical machines. We will go over resource limitations on Azure SQL Database like memory usage, database size, transaction duration and Temp DB usage. We will conclude with best practices for seamless user experience on Azure SQL Database.

## Title: Upgrading and Migrating SQL Server
## Description:
### With Microsoft increasing the rate at which new versions of SQL Server are released to on average every couple of years (2008, 2008R2, 2012 & now 2014) upgrading and migrating to newer versions to make use of the new features is going to become more common.

This session will discuss and demonstrate some of the ways in which you can make this process easier and more of a day to day task than it has historically been. Looking at what tools and processes we can use to strengthen our case for an upgrade or just how to make sure that we have sized a system appropriately.

I will cover how I have upgraded and migrated to the latest versions of SQL Server all the way from SQL 2000 up to SQL 2012, what the gotchas are and how to avoid getting bitten so that you can be confident that you will have a successful migration or upgrade too.

Join me as we work through upgrading a number of SQL Servers, avoiding the pitfalls along the way.

## Description:
### Have you ever come in to work only to have the boss come tell you that your main site is down and the database is "broken"?  Fixing query performance problems can be rough, especially in high-pressure situations.  Microsoft has developed a feature to help customers gain significantly easier insight into production systems and to be able to quickly fix cases where a new plan choice from the query optimizer has undesired performance consequences.  This talk introduces the Query Store, explains the architecture, and shows how it can be used to solve real-world performance problems.  It will now be possible to ask questions like "show me what query plans have changed since yesterday" and to quickly ask the optimizer to "go back" to the query plan that was working fine for you previously.

## Description:
### Whoever coined the term "one size fits all" was not a DBA. Very large databases (VLDBs) have different needs from their smaller counterparts, and the techniques for effectively managing them need to grow along with their contents. In this session, join Microsoft Certified Master Bob Pusateri as he shares lessons learned over years of maintaining databases over 40TB in size. This talk will include techniques for speeding up maintenance operations before they start running unacceptably long, and methods for minimizing user impact for critical administrative processes. You'll also see how generally-accepted best practices aren't always the best idea for VLDB environments, and how, when, and why deviating from them can be appropriate. Just because database are huge doesn't mean they aren't manageable, attend this session and see for yourself!

### Cloud computing has emerged as an extremely successful paradigm for deploying applications. Scalability, elasticity, pay-per-use pricing, and economies of scale are some of the major reasons for the successful and widespread adoption of cloud. A cloud database is a type of database service that is built, deployed and delivered through a cloud platform. In this talk, I’ll give rapid introduction to cloud databases: what they are, where they came from, how they are implemented, and give a rough taxonomy. We'll look at some of the specific examples of the cloud databases running out there in the wild and the latest state-of-the-art cloud database research.

## Title: Writing Faster Queries Using SQL Server 2014
## Description:
### CPUs are running faster now than ever before, solid-state drives are replacing spinning disks, and database servers have terabytes of RAM. And yet we still suffer from poor database performance. Why? Because a poorly written query will bring even the best hardware to its knees. For truly great performing systems there is no substitute for properly written queries, good indexes, and a database design that takes advantage of all SQL Server has to offer. And for this we rely on the skills and expertise of DBAs and database developers.

Join Microsoft SQL Server Certified Masters, Tim Chapman and Thomas LaRock, to learn how to spot common query performance killers and what you can do to make queries execute as fast as possible.

## Speaker(s): Bob Ward
## Title: Inside SQL Server  I/O (Part 1)
## Description:
### This half-day session (note this session will show up twice back-to-back in the agenda but it is not a repeat session. You must attend both sessions to get the most out of this talk as it is “one talk”) covers the internals of how the SQL Server Engine reads and writes data to/from data and transaction log storage. 

The approach of this talk is to look at the “basic lifecycle” of I/O for database in SQL Server from creating a database, reading database pages, writing to the transaction log, and writing database pages to disk. Behind this approach I will weave in how SQLOS is involved in I/O, Windows APIs, background processes (Ex. checkpoint), monitoring tools, diagnostics tools, error conditions, troubleshooting, trace flags, and more.

In addition the following topics will be covered as they relate to I/O:

•	Building Indexes
•	Altering Databases
•	Backup/Restore Basics
•	DBCC
•	Reading the transaction log
•	Tempdb
•	Resource Governor
•	Shutting down
•	Cloud Hybrid I/O Scenarios
•	Hekaton

Come ready to learn and have your brain melted in this fast-paced, fact-filled, and very deep session. This is a 500+ level session and is not for everyone. As with all my “Inside” talks, I will use the Windows Debugger and other tools, have lots of demos, and often talk about Windows APIs. However, even though this is a deep session for folks who love internals, I do present practical information that can help you make informed decisions about the configuration, deployment, maintenance, and operations for your SQL Server with respect to I/O. Even though much of the information I present can apply to older versions of SQL Server, all materials will be presented will be based on the internals of SQL Server 2012 and SQL Server 2014.

## Title: T-SQL Window Function Deep Dive (Part 2)
## Description:
### Join this session and learn everything you need to know about T-SQL windowing functions!

SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. This session will teach you how to avoid cursor solutions and create simpler code by using the windowing functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world.

You will also learn what you need to know to take full advantage of these features to get great performance. We’ll also discuss which features perform worse or better than older techniques, what to watch out for in the execution plan, and more.

## Description:
### Last evening Dr. Barto had an idea on the plane that he wanted to investigate.  He was looking for patterns in Drug usage and disease track for his Clinical trial session in the morning.  He logged into his hosted portal in O365 and asked some questions to the historical data his facility has stored in the cloud and surfaced through Power BI.  He also saw a report that he liked and posts some questions through Yammer.  He captured a graph in one of his presentations for Wednesday and sent a note to his analyst Matt Smith to asked for him to check the hypothesis he has arrived at. Matt quickly identifies the appropriate data source that supports Dr. Barto's hypothesis, adds it to the data model Dr. Barto is using and sets him up to speak to these results in his Clinical Trial session via Lync. Dr. Barto delivered a successful data supported session to his peers and has transformed how, when, and what drug treatments are used for in-patient and post operation disease procedures.

## Title: From Minutes to Milliseconds: High-Performance SSRS Tuning
## Description:
### Even though you're an experienced report developer or administrator, performance tuning for SQL Server Reporting Services still feels as bewildering and hopeless as folding a fitted bed sheet. You've made your data sets smaller and timeouts longer, but it's not enough to remove the slowness dragging down your reporting environment.

In this session, you'll learn how design and configuration choices put pressure on your report server and techniques to relieve that pressure. You’ll see how to configure your Reporting Services databases for speed, streamline your subscription schedules, and use caching for high-demand reports. You'll also learn some design strategies to lighten your report processing load. If you want to maximize the speed of your Reporting Services environment and minimize the pain of performance tuning, this session is for you.

## Description:
### In-Memory OLTP introduces a new optimistic multi-versioned concurrency control (MVCC) model for memory-optimized tables that is lock-free and supports the isolation levels SNAPSHOT, REPEATABLE READ, and SERIALIZABLE. We explain how SQL Server achieves these isolation levels without taking locks. We will look at the innards of In-Memory OLTP transactions, and touch on concepts such as transaction validation, commit dependencies, and the read-, write-, and scan-sets. Finally, we see how SQL Server can guarantee transaction isolation for mixed transaction that use locking/blocking for disk-based table and optimistic MVCC for memory-optimized tables.

## Speaker(s): Argenis Fernandez
## Title: Making DBCC CHECKDB Go Faster
## Description:
### Great DBAs know that proper implementation of consistency checks is one of their most important tasks. CHECKDB run times are directly influenced by database size; the data explosion of recent years has taken its toll, resulting in long runs and massive impact on our production systems. In this session you will learn how to improve your system to reduce the time that it takes to run CHECKDB or the individual DBCC CHECK* commands, decrease strain on your production systems, and improve overall system health. Topics covered will include parallelism, tempdb configuration, trace flags, and resource governor. All of these elements -- and many more -- influence the behavior and run time of DBCC CHECKDB. Along the session you will explore a real-life example involving consistency checking at a very large, very active OLTP environment. Using the various techniques covered in this talk, run time was reduced by 97% -- from seven days to a mere six hours. Learn how to performance tune CHECKDB!
