## Title: Advanced SQL Server Availability and Storage Solutions
## Description:
### ** This Pre-Conference session is currently sold out **

The options for achieving and increasing the reliability of SQL Server databases and instances as well as storing the associated data have changed in the past few years. Not only are the features and combinations for deploying SQL Server instances and databases greater than in the past, but as we move to a software defined world, achieving availability and performance is both easier and more difficult at the same time.

This full day pre-conference session will cover the latest SQL Server availability and storage solutions including how to plan, deploy, and administer them. Topics covered will include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed Availability Groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Domain Independent Availability Groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In-place WSFC upgrades&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scale Out File Server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Storage Spaces Direct&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Storage Replica&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQL Server 2017 on Linux and its availability story&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQL Server features versus hardware and other things in the operating system or hypervisor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tips, tricks, and gotchas for on premises virtualization, and public cloud deployments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In addition to the instructional content, each student will gain hands on experience via lab scenarios using their own laptop connected to Web-based virtual machines where learning translates into action to bring a solution to life.

Whether you are looking to update your availability arsenal or catch up on what is new for availability and storage for SQL Server, this pre-conference will put you ahead of the curve to be able to take advantage of what features are offered today and what is coming tomorrow.

## Title: Azure Infrastructure 
## Description:
### In this daylong session, we’ll review all the various infrastructure components that make up the Microsoft Azure platform. When it comes to moving SQL Server systems into the Azure platform having a solid understanding of the Azure infrastructure will make migrations successful and making support solutions much easier.
 
Designing your Azure infrastructure properly from the beginning is extremely important. An improperly designed and configured infrastructure will provide performance problems, manageability problems, and can be difficult to resolve without downtime.
 
As Azure scales around the world many more companies, no matter where they are located, will be begin moving services from on-premises data centers into the Azure Cloud, and a solid foundation is key to successful migrations.

## Title: Data Modeling with Power BI
## Description:
### You have data, and you have Power BI. So why can’t you glean any real insights into the information? Or maybe you’re dealing with a different problem: As you examine your data, you’re struggling to write the formula that provides the numbers you need. Either way, your problem is most likely with the data model. 

This full-day pre-con introduces the basic techniques of shaping data models in Power BI. We’ll assess real-world examples that will help you look at your reports in a different way, and show you that with the right data model, the correct answer is always a simple one!

In this workshop, you will learn how to: &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define business model entities and measures (dimensions and facts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Properly model header/details structures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use multiple fact tables, like sales and purchases, in a complex data model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage calendar-related calculations using the proper date tables &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track historical attributes, like previous addresses of customers or manager assignments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use snapshots to compute quantity on hand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

### Learn practical Columnstore Indexes tips and tricks such as which type to use, how and when to use Disk-Based vs. In-Memory or Clustered vs. Nonclustered, how to load data into Columnstore in the most efficient way, and how to get the best performance possible out of the Batch Execution Mode.

With a nod to each of the available SQL Server versions (2012, 2014, 2016, 2017 and the Azure SQLDB), this full day session focuses on practical solutions and applications of Columnstore Indexes and the Batch Execution Mode. We also review the limitations of both and learn how to solve some of those limitations.  

Covering all available relational engines supporting Columnstore Indexes (including parts of the SQL DataWarehouse), this pre-conference will give you insight on why and when to use Columnstore Indexes, and when to take a step back and use a different type of technology.

Since November 2016 (and more specifically since Service Pack 1 for SQL Server 2016), Columnstore Indexes have been available for every Edition of SQL Server (including Express and Local editions). Join this workshop and become a part of the columnar revolution that is positively affecting database platforms around the world.

### C++ was widely denigrated as a "hopelessly complex" language with "way too many moving parts", and in truth, it was a language made up of three dominant paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, and meta-programmatic. C#, by contrast, has five dominant paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, meta-programmatic, functional and now dynamic. (Visual Basic doesn't fare much better on this score.) If we're to use these new multi-paradigm languages successfully, we'd better have a good idea of what the paradigms are, what a language paradigm is, and what the different paradigms are in the languages we know and love.

## Speaker(s): Douglas Barrett
## Title: Positioning IT for Success Through Automation
## Description:
### Since the dawn of analytics projects, IT teams have wrestled with the concept of “time to value”.  Projects often die before being delivered, or fizzle over time because data warehouses and business systems can be slow to build and difficult to evolve as data and business requirements change.  

Additionally, while business users are heavily invested in getting the information they need to make decisions as quickly as possible, they seldom have the technical knowledge to ask for the “right data” for the decision the first time. Agile projects are designed for this challenge – start with what we know, build a prototype, socialize, adapt and refine. But, unfortunately, delays associated with traditional tools and projects, such as those relying on ETL tools, can further exasperate and ultimately drive business users to work around IT and start experimenting with their own BI tools.

Organizations are best served with a single, persistent, enterprise data repository (data warehouse) that will travel with the business as its evolves rather than short-sighted, decentralized development and desktop efforts. So how do we empower our skilled IT development teams to be more agile and deliver useful solutions to the business sooner?
Automation can help teams greatly speed up agile project development and turn “time to value” into an asset when measuring the success of your IT organization.  

In this session, you’ll learn how data warehouse automation can help IT teams to:
• Speed up project delivery by leveraging flexible design and code patterns backed by metadata
• Automatically generate documentation to aid support and reduce development backlog
• Payback technical debt that is typically lost within agile projects

Come and learn how automating the design, development and ongoing operation of data warehouse projects is setting hundreds of IT organizations worldwide, large and small, in a stronger position to deliver to the business and make better use of their resources.

## Speaker(s): Paul Andrew
## Title: Working with Azure Data Factory & Creating Custom Activities
## Description:
### In this session, we’ll go beyond the Azure Data Factory copy activity normally presented using the limited Azure Portal wizard. Extract and load are never the hard parts of the pipeline. It is the ability to transform, manipulate and clean our data that normally requires more effort. Sadly, this task doesn’t come so naturally to Azure Data Factory as an orchestration tool so we need to rely on its custom activities to break out the C# or VB to perform such tasks. Using Visual Studio, we’ll look at how to do exactly that and see what’s involved in Azure to utilise this pipeline extensibility feature. What handles the compute for the compiled .Net code and how can does this get deployed by ADF? With real world use cases, we’ll learn how to fight back against those poorly formed CSV files and what we can do if Excel files are our only data source. Plus, lots of useful tips and tricks along the way when working with this emerging technology.

## Speaker(s): Rajnikant Tandel, Anup Gopinathan
## Title: Optimize SQL Server: Become a Query Tuning Master
## Description:
### In any given SQL Server instance, there are likely 8 to 10 queries or stored procedures that are responsible for 80 to 90 percent of the poorly tuned activity that you see throughout the day. If you can identify these problem queries and tune them, you can make a significant impact on the overall performance of your server. A key component of overall application performance tuning is query tuning. Writing queries in an efficient manner, and making sure they execute in the most optimal way possible, is always a challenge.  This presentation will explain few scenarios of tuning the queries including before and after performance differences. Scenarios such as, use of SQL server 2016 in-memory tables over normal table or explicit transaction over auto commit.

Event Date: 01-11-2017 13:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Perform
## Speaker(s): Erin Stellato
## Title: Query Store and Automatic Tuning in SQL Server
## Description:
### One of the most highly anticipated new features in the SQL Server 2016 release was Query Store. It's referred to as the "flight data recorder" for SQL Server because it tracks query information over time – including the text, the plan, and execution statistics. The addition of wait statistics information – tracked for each query plan – in SQL Server 2017 makes Query Store a tool that every data professional needs to know how to use, whether you're new to troubleshooting or someone who's been doing it for years. When you include the new Automatic Tuning feature in SQL Server 2017, suddenly it seems like you might spend less time fighting fires and more time enjoying a lunch break that’s not at your desk. 

In this session, we'll walk through Query Store with a series of demos designed to help you understand how you can immediately start to use it once you’ve upgraded to SQL Server 2016 or 2017. We'll review the different options for Query Store, look at the data collected (including wait stats!), check out how to force a plan, and dive into how you can leverage Automatic Plan Correction and reduce the time you spend on Severity 1 calls fighting fires.  It’s time to embrace the future and learn how to make troubleshooting easier using the plethora of intelligent data natively captured in SQL Server and SQL Azure Database.

Co-presenter: Dejan Krakovic, a Senior Software Engineer from Microsoft who helped develop Query Store and originally implement it for those 2 million (!) user databases in SQL Azure.

## Speaker(s): Gianluca Sartori
## Title: Responding to Extended Events in Near Real-Time
## Description:
### Extended Events provide deep insight into SQL Server's behavior and allow us to gather information not available by other means. However, compared to other technologies such as SQL Trace and Event Notifications, Extended Events don't seem to provide a way to react to the events as soon as they happen.

In this session we will see how the Extended Events streaming API can be used to process events in a near real-time fashion. We will demonstrate how this technology enables new possibilities to solve real world problems, such as capturing and notifying deadlocks or blocking sessions. We will also offer a different approach to analyzing captured events, without shredding XML files.

## Speaker(s): Steve Jones, Grant Fritchey, Richard Macaskill
## Title: How DevOps for the Database Helps with Compliance
## Description:
### More and more software teams are turning to DevOps to enable them to deliver value to the business and their customers more quickly. Environments, databases and frequency of change are all on the increase, as is the need to be compliant with a growing number of regulations and policies governing the use of data. So what should database teams do: slow delivery down or accelerate the oversight?

In this session, Redgate shows how a DevOps approach to the database – including the automated provisioning, testing, deploying, monitoring and desensitizing of databases - is actually an essential component of compliance, not a barrier.

## Title: From Dull to Dazzling: How Visualization Enhances Data Comprehension
## Description:
### Our applications and devices are gathering and storing data at unprecedented levels. Once the information is in our data centers we need tools to help us understand the hidden knowledge contained in that stockpile. We’ve got business intelligence tools that can help but at some point in the data analytics cycle you need to show results to the stakeholder. That’s when choosing the correct visual representation of the data becomes vital. Do it wrong and the data is merely wrapped in pretty graphics; do it right and the user perceives their information in clear and meaningful patterns. There has been an explosion of research on ways to present data in graphical form in the last decade. This is often called Data Visualization or Information Graphics and it is becoming a must have skill for UI developers. This session explores the overall visual concepts that make data easier to grasp. Do you know the best way to show data to your users, so that the information is clear and understandable? Come to this session to learn how to make your data shine.

## Description:
### Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works, but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool.
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool!
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events. 
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king!

## Speaker(s): Rimma Nehme
## Title: Globally Distributed Databases Made Simple
## Description:
### Public clouds are quickly making massive-scale computing capabilities available to an ever-larger population of developers and data professionals. These computing capabilities are no longer a playground restricted to a small handful of large-scale internet services organizations. In 2014, I gave my first talk at PASS summit on Cloud Databases 101 – a lot has changed since then. Globally distributed databases in the cloud have created a dramatic impact in today’s business landscape. In my talk this year, I will provide a deep dive understanding into Azure Cosmos DB, Microsoft’s globally distributed, multi-model database service that was 7 years in the making. We’ll take an under the covers look at the system and discuss various design trade-offs that had to be made to allow customers to elastically and horizontally scale both throughput and storage globally. We’ll also discuss how the system can provide single digit millisecond latencies with 99.99% high availability. I will also share some of our real-world experiences in operating a globally distributed database service and will touch on how Azure Cosmos DB compares to the competition (including Google Spanner, AWS DynamoDB, Cassandra, MongoDB and others). How Cosmos DB relates and works with other technologies like stream analytics, Azure Machine Learning, predictive analytics will also be covered. You’ll walk away with a simple yet comprehensive understanding of Cosmos DB and an appreciation for the beauty of the system.

## Title: Introduction to Cortana  – Turning Data into Intelligent Action
## Description:
### According to the Economist magazine, data is the world’s most valuable resource.  So, it makes sense that Data Science, Azure Machine Learning, and Analytics are all becoming core pieces to the success of every business.  As data professionals, we need to know how these core pieces will affect what we do, and how we can use this suite to help our clients.  Microsoft’s Cortana suite is the central hub for learning and implementing each of these core pieces.  Using an easy to follow example, I will show the flow from Data to Data Intelligence. The demonstration uses several pieces of the Cortana Suite and brings them together to show how they complement each other.  This overview of Cortana Suite will use the various pieces like a puzzle which, when brought together, will form a seamless picture of the whole so that participants can see that the individual pieces were meant to work together.

## Title: Azure SQL Databases: A Guided Tour
## Description:
### You know about the cloud but you’re not there yet. Is it hard? Is it easy? How do you get started? Come to this session and see for yourself. We’ll start with nothing and end up with a deployed Azure SQL Database. We’ll even run a quick PowerBI report and enable Geo-Redundant Disaster Recovery with a few clicks.

The goal is to take the mystery out, to show the capabilities and get you thinking about what going to the cloud could look like and what it can do for you and your company. I believe the future belongs to those who have this knowledge and know where to apply it.

This will be nearly PowerPoint free and we’ll log into my Azure Portal and build out an environment from scratch and learn as we go. We’ll migrate data from an “on-premises” database into our SQL DB and we’ll query it. You’ll leave with an understanding of the capabilities, some resource links outlining what we did and hopefully some curiosity to see what else is up there in the cloud as you start exploring.

## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Description:
### Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 
Here you’ll learn: 
• The most useful regular expression commands. 
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions. 
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you. 
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

## Speaker(s): Lord Richard Douglas
## Title: Understanding the Transaction Log For Faster Throughput
## Description:
### Does your application suffer from performance problems even though you followed best practices on schema design? Have you looked at your transaction log? 
There's no doubt about it, the transaction log is treated like a poor cousin. The poor thing does not receive much love. The transaction log, however, is a very essential and misunderstood part of your database. There will be a team of developers creating an absolutely awesome elegant design the likes of which have never been seen before, but the leave the transaction log using default settings. It's as if it doesn't matter, an afterthought, a relic of the platform architecture.
In this session, you will learn to appreciate how the transaction log works and how you can improve the performance of your applications by making the right architectural choices. From understanding the internals we can design for faster recovery and batch processes and ironically a smaller transaction log!

## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: Linux Clustering for the SQL Server DBA
## Description:
### With SQL Server 2017 now supporting Linux, this means that anyone who is going to use SQL Server on Linux will need a high availability and disaster recovery story. The good news is that both failover cluster instances (FCIs) and availability groups (AGs) are options just like a standard Windows Server-based deployment. However, the underlying clustering mechanism is completely different. This session will cover as well as demonstrate how to plan, implement, and administer the clustering layer of a Linux-based AG or FCI as well as teach the differences compared to deploying on a Windows Server-based architecture. If your organization plans to embrace SQL Server on Linux, this will be an essential session to attend.

Through the use of Powershell you can much more easily maintain your Azure databases. Further, once you start using Powershell to maintain the databases, you’ll be able to automate a lot more processes within your Azure environment. This session will provide you with the core knowledge to create your own Powershell scripts and it will give you a set of foundation scripts from which you can build your own. You don’t have to feel limited on what you can do just because you’re on Azure. Powershell will empower you to get more done within your Azure database environment.

## Speaker(s): Terry McCann
## Title: Enhancing Relational Models with Graph Processing in SQL Server
## Description:
### Analysing highly connected data using SQL is hard! Relational databases were simply not designed  to handle this,  but graph databases were.  Built from the ground up to understand interconnectivity, graph databases enable a flexible performant way to analyse relationships, and one has just landed in SQL Server 2017! SQL  Server supports two new table types NODE and EDGE and a new function MATCH, which enables deeper exploration of the relationships in your data than ever before. 

In this session, we seek to explore, what is a graph database, why you should be interested, what query patterns do they solve and how does SQL Server compares with competitors. We will explore each of these based on real data shredded from IMDB.

## Title: Should You Use M or R for Data Wrangling in Power BI? It Depends.
## Description:
### Since the inception of Power BI, Power Query and the M programming language have been the main option that Power BI developers had to get data into the Power BI data model. In 2016 Microsoft gave us another option. They added the the ability to use the R programming language as a data source. 

R is a very popular statistical programming language that has some powerful “data wrangling” capabilities. In this session Patrick Leblanc and Ryan Wade will explore several data wrangling task in Power BI using both M and R. We will compare the two and show when it is best to use one over the other.

## Speaker(s): Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Three Steps to Lasting Encryption
## Description:
### You’ve encrypted your data! You’ve used the latest techniques. It’s strong. It’s safe. You’re done, right? Not so fast. Encryption gets weaker with age - keys are lost, algorithms are cracked, techniques become obsolete. In time, the system breaks down, rendering your data either irretrievable or unprotected.

To keep your encryption at full strength, you need to add three practices to your regular maintenance schedule. First, backup your keys frequently and securely to ensure you can always retrieve the data you’ve encrypted. Second, rotate your keys regularly to limit your exposure due to a lost or compromised key. Third, add an encryption key management solution (like Azure Key Vault) to make managing large numbers of keys easier or to enable someone else to manage the keys. In this session, we’ll discuss how you can implement each of these practices in your own environment.

## Title: Python In SQL Server 2017
## Description:
### SQL Server 2017 is right around the corner, bringing with it a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and deliver maximum value to your Business Intelligence customers with the power of analytics!

# How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day
#### [Back to calendar](#id-749)
Event Date: 03-11-2017 08:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Support
## Speaker(s): Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day
## Description:
### You’re busy. You don’t have time to check the security of your systems all the time, right? It’s not like anyone has added a user that you don’t know about. And no one would create a database and add all logins to the db_owner role. And of course, no one would ever think of setting the TRUSTWORTHY property on a database... right?

Things like that happen on a daily basis, poking holes in even the most well-secured database. Those holes are just waiting for someone to find them. That someone could be you, or it could be an attacker probing for a way to get data from your company.

In this session, we will explore how to create reports that are quick to review so you can find the holes before someone else does - without interfering with the rest of your day. Along the way, you'll also learn where to find security-related information in SQL Server's metadata and logs to allow you to customize and extend the reports to meet your company's unique needs.

## Speaker(s): Aaron Cutshall
## Title: "There Be Whales Here!" -- Big Data in SQL Server
## Description:
### Due to varying definitions of Big Data which confuse data volume and data organization, the common perception is that Big Data requires the use of Hadoop, MongoDB, or another NoSQL database.  SQL Server can easily store and manipulate very large volumes of data and perform quite well provided the database is properly set up and tuned.  In this session we'll cover some of the definitions and misconceptions of Big Data, look at some Big Data solutions that went horribly wrong and review a case where Big Data was successfully implemented in SQL Server.  Finally, we'll take a peek under the covers to see how SQL Server best handles Big Data through proper data models, table designs, performance tuning, and T-SQL techniques.

## Title: Monitoring Linux Performance for the SQL Server Admin
## Description:
### So you’re a SQL Server administrator and you just installed SQL Server on Linux. It’s a whole new world. Don’t fear, it’s just an operating system. It has all the same components Windows has and in this session we’ll show you that. We will look at the Linux operating system architecture and show you where to look for the performance data you’re used to! Further we'll dive into SQLPAL and how it architecture and internals enables high performance for your SQL Server. By the end of this session you’ll be ready to go back to the office and have a solid understanding of performance monitoring Linux systems and SQL on Linux. We’ll look at the core system components of CPU, Disk, Memory and Networking monitoring techniques for each and look some of the new tools available including new DMVs and DBFS.

# When Partitioning Indexes Hurts Performance (and How to Fix It)
#### [Back to calendar](#id-749)
Event Date: 03-11-2017 08:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Perform
## Speaker(s): Kendra Little
## Title: When Partitioning Indexes Hurts Performance (and How to Fix It)
## Description:
### Table partitioning is a fantastic tool to help you manage tables with skyrocketing rowcounts. SQL Server 2016 SP1 made table partitioning available in Standard Edition, so you may be planning to add partitioning to your database.

But some queries may get slower after you partition your tables: the SQL Server optimizer doesn’t always use indexes the same way after those indexes are partitioned into chunks.

This session teaches you to use execution plans to troubleshoot regressed queries using partitioned tables. You will learn what “non-aligned” indexes are, how to tell how many partitions a query is really using, and see options for TSQL and indexing changes to speed up your queries.

## Speaker(s): Vern Rabe
## Title: Proper DataType Usage=Guaranteed Better Performance and Accuracy
## Description:
### It’s an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. 

In this demo-heavy presentation I will show you the importance of choosing the proper data type; show you some guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be; and once chosen, give you some tools for its usage and management. I will demonstrate several performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of inappropriate data types or improper usage of them. In addition I will cover several data type related functions, and point out caveats in their usage. I expect even advanced T-SQL developers and DBAs to walk away with a useful nugget or two.

## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: DAX Best Practices
## Description:
### As with any other language, you can write good DAX but you can also write bad DAX. Good DAX works fine, it is fast and reliable and can be updated easily. Bad DAX, on the other hand is… well, just bad.

In this session, we will show several DAX formulas, taken from our experience as consultants and teachers, analyzing (very briefly) the performances and looking for errors, or for different ways of writing them. As you will see, writing good DAX means following some simple rules and, of course, understanding well how evaluation contexts work!

## Speaker(s): Stuart Moore
## Title: Get on the Azure Service Bus
## Description:
### You have a carefully looked after on premises production database, but you need to connect to it from an Azure hosted application. How can you do that without compromising security or having to provision VPNs? Your new application MUST be up for customers 24/7, is it possible to decouple this from your database to allow for patching and maintenance windows?

 Azure Service Bus may be the solution you're looking for. 

On-Premise Service Bus architectures have been around for a while, but setting one up, maintaining it, and scaling it have been a full time job in themselves. Now with Azure Service Bus, setting up requires just a few clicks, scaling takes a few more and maintenance is done for you.

We'll cover common design patterns, what Azure Service Bus can offer you, setting it up, configuring for performance and availability, and showing how your clients can interact with it.

## Speaker(s): Artur Kiulian
## Title: Future of Work: Human Assistance in the Intelligent Workplace
## Description:
### Big companies are trying to outsource their processes to machines, or at least break them apart into pieces that can be automated. This may be a major concern to an unskilled layer of workers. It can also be a stimulus for spending those saved costs on more qualified specialists in the missing areas instead.

But how do machines make certain decisions? Even Google engineers are out of touch with how their algorithms work now thanks to the system’s complexity, which could prevent us from completely trusting AI. To clear up this issue Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently funded research to make new a kind of artificial intelligence algorithms that can properly explain themselves and their conclusions.

And what better way to know something than to ask directly? Conversation as a technology has been creeping its way into the picture for many years. It seems now we are finally reaching a state where it can become usable to some extent. This trend will set apart companies that are leveraging intelligent assistance from those that are still trying to better processes by simply hiring more humans.

## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: "But It Worked in Development!" - 3 Hard Performance Problems
## Description:
### Warning: this is not an introductory session. These are going to be tough problems.

You've been performance tuning queries and indexes for a few years, but lately, you've been running into problems you can't explain. Could it be RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE, THREADPOOL, or lock escalation? These problems only pop up under heavy load or concurrency, so they're very hard to detect in a development environment.

In a very fast-paced session, I'll show these three performance problems pop up under load. I won't be able to teach you how to fix them for good - not inside the span of 75 minutes - but at least you'll be able to recognize the symptoms when they strike, and I'll show you where to go to learn more.

# SQL Server 2016 Always On AGs:  Perf, Internals, Lessons Learned
#### [Back to calendar](#id-749)

## Speaker(s): Jimmy May
## Title: SQL Server 2016 Always On AGs:  Perf, Internals, Lessons Learned
## Description:
### Always On Availability Groups (AGs) were introduced in SQL Server 2012. AGs significantly expanded our HA/DR options. However, in both SQL 2012 and SQL 2014 two limitations were extant in the code—both Network Transport and Log Redo significantly compromised performance. In SQL Server 2016, these limitations have been significantly improved. My work shows enhancements of 7x – 10x, allowing over ½GB/s (4Gb/s) across the wire. These improvements expand solutions options for Tier 1 OLTP and Data Warehouse workloads, Tier 1 and Tier 2 consolidation, and more. This presentation explains the improvements, characterizes the new solutions, and documents how commodity servers and modern non-shared in-server flash storage demonstrate the profound contrast between SQL Server 2014 vs. 2016. Doing so moves the performance bottleneck from the SQL Server codebase to the CPU—exactly where it belongs.

## Speaker(s): Rajnikant Tandel, Anup Gopinathan
## Title: Optimize SQL Server: Become a Query Tuning Master
## Description:
### In any given SQL Server instance, there are likely 8 to 10 queries or stored procedures that are responsible for 80 to 90 percent of the poorly tuned activity that you see throughout the day. If you can identify these problem queries and tune them, you can make a significant impact on the overall performance of your server. A key component of overall application performance tuning is query tuning. Writing queries in an efficient manner, and making sure they execute in the most optimal way possible, is always a challenge.  This presentation will explain few scenarios of tuning the queries including before and after performance differences. Scenarios such as, use of SQL server 2016 in-memory tables over normal table or explicit transaction over auto commit.

## Title: Azure SQL VM: Implementing Multi-subnet Basic AG in SQL2016 STD
## Description:
### For a long time database professionals have been asking Microsoft to make Always on Availability Groups (AG) available in Standard Edition. With SQL Server 2016 SP1, Microsoft responded with Basic Availability Groups, a limited – but very functional – version of Always on Availability Groups.

Basic Availability Groups enable Data Professionals to provide enterprise class Hight Availability solutions using SQL Server Standard Edition, which allows organizations to save money by providing High Availability (HA) for applications that require HA without paying for SQL Server Enterprise Edition features they do not need.

In this session, we will be covering:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limitations on Basic Availability Groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Components and steps necessary to configure a Basic AG for an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) running SQL Server 2016 and multi-subnet scenario&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advantages, components and steps to configure Windows Storage Spaces to improve IO throughput in a Azure VM running SQL Server 2016 SP1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

### Cosmos is Azure's NoSQL Database as a Service, born in the cloud and designed take advantage of the flexibility, elasticity and global reach of cloud computing.

Cosmos offers different access APIs, consistency models and performance management models that are different from a classic relational database like SQL Server. However, the same principles that you already apply as a SQL Dba are as important as ever to build a Cosmos application that performs well, is cost efficient and resilient to failures.

In this session we will look at how Cosmos is different from a relational database, it's major features as a NoSQL cloud product and how you can apply your SQL Server experience to perform successful Cosmos deployments.

## Title: Using Integration Services 2016 to Manage a Dimensional Model
## Description:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for 2016 has improved the Enterprise Information Management (EIM) workflows needed for solid ETL in companies using the Enterprise version of SQL Server. Some tools have been made available for Standard edition with Service Pack 1.

This session will go through some old and new features of Integration Service to help with loading data for Slowly Changing Dimensions as well as incremental loads for fact tables in a Dimensional Model. Data Quality Services was added in a previous version but it still a great end-user tool that can manage lookups for bad data from source systems. The SSISDB Catalog for Project deployment, management and reporting has been enhanced with a Package deployment mode everybody has been waiting for. The ability to extract column names when piping error rows is now available in 2016.

Take the jump with me to SQL Server Integration Services 2016 for modern data importing and cleansing.

## Title: Bridging the DBA and Developer Relationship
## Description:
### In today’s world, things are moving more quickly than ever before with more technologies and products being utilized by both the developer and database administrator communities. There is often a disconnect, however, between developers and DBAs. Bridging the gap between database development and system/application development can make the difference between an efficient, well-managed business solution and one that fails to meet expectations. When was the last time you thought about the developers and DBAs within your organization working together? Is that something your organization discusses or do you separate the two sides and keep them isolated? Do you think this is important for today’s technical teams? If so, join Grant Fritchey and Chris Woodruff as they discuss this important relationship and answer your questions.

## Description:
### What will happen when a BI Expert is analyzing statistics and a Performance Tuner is creating Power BI reports based on that analysis?  A dynamic learning experience from two experienced professionals.
 
The SQL Server optimizer uses distribution statistics when creating execution plans. Statistics are used to provide the optimizer with estimations for the best way to process the query and hopefully optimize performance.
 
Power BI is a powerful tool that has been released in the last few years that helps you visualize your information to help make informative decisions with rich visualization.
 
In this session, we will show you how SQL Server uses statistics to create the execution plan and Power BI to visualize that statistical distribution; with a TWIST.  Roles will be reversed to show a dynamic and interactive learning experience helping users with two different concepts in one exciting session!

## Speaker(s): Tim Mitchell
## Title: SSIS and the Cloud: Yes, They Can Get Along
## Description:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) has been around since the cloud was just a term to describe the weather. SSIS is great at handling most any on-premises data load need, but that doesn't mean that it can't be used for cloud or on-prem/cloud hybrid architectures. With the flexibility in its legacy behaviors and the new cloud-specific tasks and components, Integration Services is versatile enough to wrangle both traditional on-prem and cloud-based ETL needs.

In this session, we will cover how SQL Server Integration Services can play well with the cloud. We'll review and demonstrate how existing SSIS tasks and components can be used for cloud or hybrid load scenarios, and will walk through some of the newest tools built specifically for cloud endpoints. We will also discuss the role SSIS plays in the enterprise alongside other cloud data integration tools, including Azure Data Factory (ADF).

## Speaker(s): Davide Mauri
## Title: Dapper: The MicroORM That Will Change Your Life
## Description:
### ORM or Stored Procedures? Code First or Database First? Ad-Hoc Queries? Impedance Mismatch? If you're a developer or you are a DBA working with developers you have heard all this terms at least once in your life…and usually in the middle of a strong discussion, debating about one or the other. 
Well, thanks to StackOverflow's Dapper, all these fights are finished. Dapper is a blazing fast microORM that allows developers to map SQL queries to classes automatically, leaving (and encouraging) the usage of stored procedures, parameterized statements and all the good stuff that SQL Server offers (JSON and TVP are supported too!) 
In this session I'll show how to use Dapper in your projects from the very basis to some more complex usages that will help you to create *really fast* applications without the burden of huge and complex ORMs. 
The days of Impedance Mismatch are finally over!

## Speaker(s): Ola Hallengren
## Title: Performance Monitoring Using Extended Events, DMVs & Query Store
## Description:
### Extended Events, Dynamic Management Views (DMVs), and Query Store are powerful and lightweight tools that gives you a lot of data when analyzing performance problems.  All this is great news for database administrators. The challenge is which tool to use for which problems and how to combine the data.

Imagine a scenario where you are getting timeouts from a business critical application, the users are complaining, and you are trying to understand what is happening. You have data from XEvents, you are looking in the execution related DMVs, and now you are trying to find the query in Query Store. How do you put it all together?

In this session you will learn techniques for combining the data from these tools, to gain great insight, when analyzing performance problems. We will look at common real-world problems, do the troubleshooting step by step, and visualize the data using PowerBI.

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Implementing Row Level Security in SQL Server
## Description:
### Since the early days of SQL Server, it has been possible to use basic security measures to allow (and disallow) user access to any object in a database, and even limit access to a given column. A more difficult task has been to limit access to the individual rows in a table. This has made application development more complex because whereas most every user may have access to a table like HR.Employee, not every employee will have access to every employee's data. In this session I will cover several techniques to limit access to rows, from methods that have existed since early versions of SQL Server, to the new Row Level Security feature in SQL Server 2016. If time permits, an overview of Dynamic Data Masking will be included, since it is a related technology.

## Title: Behavior-Driven Development and Test Automation: Agile Enablement for DW and BI Teams
## Description:
### Regardless of whether your data warehousing (DW)/business intelligence (BI) team is dedicated to Scrum, is a fan of Kanban, or is focused on XP, “Agile” in any form calls for small increments of potentially deployable results – which means that clear requirements and QA are essential. As we develop these small increments, we need to not only test the new development, but also regression test what we’ve already built. Our test suite grows larger with each iteration, and reactive, manual testing quickly becomes infeasible. Agile requires that we specify small, testable requirements and automate our tests so that regression testing doesn’t become a development bottleneck. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and test automation are key practices that allow data warehouse and business intelligence teams to be more successful in their agile journeys. While there are lots of requirements and test practices, and automation tools, out there for software development teams to leverage, very few are targeted to data-related development and testing. Learn about essential agile test foundations, BDD, and data-focused test automation technologies to help data warehousing and business intelligence teams get a leg up on these important agile practices. 

This session will cover:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why test automation is important for agile DW/BI teams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why DW/BI teams are not automating their tests today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The path to data-focused test automation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Behavior-Driven Development for clear specification and automatable tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where to start and what tests to automate first&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demo of a simple test automation tool that any DW/BI team can build and use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

## Title: Oracle vs. SQL Server-  The War of the Indices
## Description:
### This session is for the love of technology and learning.  Its based off research performed on objects, design and code built as similar as possible to see how Oracle and SQL Server compare in performance, usage and storage of indices.  Environments were built on-prem and in the cloud to view differences in different cloud support of database engines and based off trusted measurements in each platform so as to dig into how the use case was built, the similarities and the differences in each. 

Based off this use case, enhanced builds of more advanced index features and discussions of the advantages, reasons for the introduction and how it's effected the direction of each product, the DBAs who are responsible for them and resources. 

Takeaways are:
1.	Receive a strong education on platform differences between Oracle and SQL Server.
2.	Discover hidden insight on index storage and costs.
3.	Learn about great tips on maintaining index health

## Speaker(s): Eugene Meidinger
## Title: Introduction to M (a.k.a Power Query)
## Description:
### When it comes to getting your data into Excel or Power BI, M is your best choice. The M Language (A.K.A Power Query) is a powerful tool for self-service data preparation. However, it's not clear where it fits compared to tools like SSIS or TSQL. It's also not clear what it's limitations are. This session will cover the basics of M and when to use it.

In this session, we'll demonstrate how M is a linear series of transformations, just like a set of steps from a recipe. We'll show how 80% of what you will ever need to do can be done from the GUI. We'll also talk about how to write custom code for that other 20%. By the end of this presentation, you'll be able to take any manual cleanup you do today and turn it into a repeatable process with M.

## Title: Linux Administration for the SQL Server DBA
## Description:
### Times are certainly changing with Microsoft’s recent announcement to adopt the Linux operating system with the release of SQL Server 2017, and you should be prepared to support it. But, what is Linux? Why run your critical databases on an unfamiliar operating system? How do you handle the basics, such as backing up to a network share or add additional drives for data, logs, and tempdb files?

This introductory session will help seasoned SQL Server DBAs understand the basics of Linux and how it differs from Windows, all the way from basic management to performance monitoring. By the end of the session, you will be able to launch your own Linux-based SQL Server instance on a production-ready VM.

## Title: Two Guys and a Transformation: ETL Best Practices and Techniques
## Description:
### ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) is the backbone of any data project and can be upwards of 70% or more of the effort. The tools you have access to allow you to make progress in a hurry. However, are you implementing best practices and techniques that will scale to the demands you need? Or will you be refactoring far too quickly than you should to meet performance requirements?
Gain helpful insights from decades of lessons learned and walk away with best practices you can implement in your own ETL solution.

## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Tuning In-Memory Indexes 
## Description:
### SQL Server’s memory-optimized tables support two new kinds of indexes: hash and range. How are these indexes different than the B-tree indexes on your disk-based tables and how do they help in-memory OLTP achieve such blazing-fast performance? 

You'll learn how to:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the internal structure of hash and range indexes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the pros, cons, and best practices for both types of indexes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine the metadata that shows how the indexes on memory-optimized tables are being used&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

## Speaker(s): Carlos L Chacon
## Title: Measure Performance Through Baselines
## Description:
### You get a ticket or email indicating there is a problem with the database and are asked to review.  How do you know there is a problem?  Baselines.  Without a set known measurements to compare against it will be impossible to know whether your change is helping.  This session reviews the process for collecting information about your SQL Server so you can compare current processes with historical processes.  Once you understand the current behavior of the database, you can measure the impact of any change.  This session will review ways to set up the collection of performance information and make it available for review later.

## Title: Adaptive Query Plans? What’s Up With That?
## Description:
### One of the new features announced for SQL Server 2017 is Adaptive Query Plans, query plans that can change after the query starts executing.

This session will show why this is a radical departure from the way that things have worked until now and how it can improve the performance of some query forms. We’ll look at the places where adaptive query plans work and compare the performance of queries using adaptive query plans to see just what kind of improvement it can make.
