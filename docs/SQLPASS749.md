## Speaker(s): Ginger Grant
## Title: Applied Data Science for the SQL Server Professional
## Description:
### This full day session is designed to be a practical revelation of Data Science concepts tailored for data professionals.  Attendees will learn the processes data scientist employ in problem solving to understand how they can be implemented in a data environment. 
The methods used to create a data science solution are broken down into understandable sections, to make the concepts readily grasped and provide a structure to implement them in real-world environments. By first understanding the process, then building on that by learning methods for algorithm selection, solutions can be created and applied using Python, Azure ML, R or Power BI.  As these tools and languages are not well known in the data community, each will be introduced to provide a basic understanding of each, as no prior data science knowledge is expected by session attendees.

Deploying data science solutions is a topic nearly as important as creating the solution itself as improperly deployed the solution cannot be successful.  This course will also cover how to optimally configure a SQL Server 2016 or 2017 environment to run and monitor data science solutions in R and Python on SQL Server without adversely impacting other SQL Server operations.  Learn how R and Python solutions can be deployed and what can be done to improve the solution performance. Visualization techniques in the solution will be explored so that attendees will know their options and the best tool for the job, which may be Power BI or SQL Server itself.

With the introduction of SQL Server 2017, there are an increasing number of different tools, including, R, Python, Azure ML, and Power BI, which can be used to implement data science solutions. This session explores how to determine the best tool for a given situation by revealing the strengths and weakness of each technology to provide attendees with the knowledge they will need for that evaluation in their unique environment.

## Speaker(s): Jeremy Likness
## Title: Modern Web API Design
## Description:
### The Web API Design workshop explores how developers and database architects can surface practical interfaces to applications and data in the modern cloud-based world of microservices. Best practices for APIs have evolved from “remote procedure call” (RPC) formats and XML over Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), to modern REST, OData, and graph-based APIs with JSON payloads. 

This workshop starts with a review of popular open source APIs and addresses the difference between procedure-based, event-based, and data-based approaches. Understand approaches to API security including the popular JavaScript Web Token (JWT) standard, learn how to handle authorization for authenticated users, review common patterns for validating data and handling errors, and proactively tackle common enterprise challenges such as versioning endpoints. 

See hands-on how APIs are built, implemented, and deployed leveraging modern tools like Visual Studio and the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Learn how to use Swagger to document API endpoints, how to manage legacy APIs using Azure API Management, and how to gain insights into the usage and health of endpoints. 

Finally, leverage the power of building a client SDK to empower end users to quickly and easily connect to APIs with examples in .NET and Node.js.

Event Date: 30-10-2017 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (Full Day) - Track: Perform
## Speaker(s): Erin Stellato
## Title: Solving Common Performance Problems Using Query Store
## Description:
### One of the best new features of SQL Server 2016 is Query Store; it’s a game-changer for data professionals. Have you ever had that emergency where you’re informed “The database is slow! It was fine yesterday! Nothing changed!”?  How often have you wished for a query’s baseline metrics so that you could quickly compare pre- and post-upgrade performance?  Have you ever flailed about querying DMV after DMV to figure out the *real* problem with performance?  

It’s time to stop reacting; it’s time to let Query Store help.  

In this full-day workshop we’ll dive into the internals of Query Store and cover configuration; the data it captures; and how to use it analyze performance, find regressions, and force plans. The demos will teach you how to interrogate the data to find common patterns in query performance using T-SQL and visualization techniques, and how to take advantage of the wait statistics information captured.  Finally, we will end the day working with the Automatic Tuning feature in SQL Server 2017, so you can see how to free up your time for other tasks. You'll leave this class with the skills to find and leverage important information in Query Store to make query tuning easier.

## Title: Azure Infrastructure 
## Description:
### In this daylong session, we’ll review all the various infrastructure components that make up the Microsoft Azure platform. When it comes to moving SQL Server systems into the Azure platform having a solid understanding of the Azure infrastructure will make migrations successful and making support solutions much easier.
 
Designing your Azure infrastructure properly from the beginning is extremely important. An improperly designed and configured infrastructure will provide performance problems, manageability problems, and can be difficult to resolve without downtime.
 
As Azure scales around the world many more companies, no matter where they are located, will be begin moving services from on-premises data centers into the Azure Cloud, and a solid foundation is key to successful migrations.

## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: Data Modeling with Power BI
## Description:
### You have data, and you have Power BI. So why can’t you glean any real insights into the information? Or maybe you’re dealing with a different problem: As you examine your data, you’re struggling to write the formula that provides the numbers you need. Either way, your problem is most likely with the data model. 

This full-day pre-con introduces the basic techniques of shaping data models in Power BI. We’ll assess real-world examples that will help you look at your reports in a different way, and show you that with the right data model, the correct answer is always a simple one!

In this workshop, you will learn how to: &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define business model entities and measures (dimensions and facts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Properly model header/details structures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use multiple fact tables, like sales and purchases, in a complex data model&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage calendar-related calculations using the proper date tables &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track historical attributes, like previous addresses of customers or manager assignments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use snapshots to compute quantity on hand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

## Speaker(s): Itzik Ben-Gan
## Title: Mastering T-SQL Querying Fundamentals
## Description:
### If you work with SQL Server in any capacity, as a developer, DBA, BI specialist, data scientist, power user, you need to know your T-SQL. The thing is, this language is deceptive. When you start learning it you quickly get to write queries with filters, sorting, grouping, joining, and so on. You might get a false sense of confidence and the wrong impression that the language is easy to master. In reality, many people get to learn T-SQL without a good understanding the fundamentals, and this often leads to using the language incorrectly. Often people assume things about the language that are not guaranteed, and end up with bugs in their code.

This seminar is dedicated to correct understanding of T-SQL querying fundamentals. You will learn about logical query processing—probably the most critical aspect of T-SQL that any T-SQL practitioner should master. It explains how queries are interpreted, and how to write T-SQL code with the correct mindset. The seminar also covers fundamentals of query constructs like joins, subqueries, table expressions (derived tables, CTEs, views, table valued functions), the APPLY operator, and set operators. With each of the topics there’s also a section covering several trickier aspects that are beyond the fundamentals. 
The seminar also covers some of the newest additions to T-SQL in SQL Server 2016 and 2017 like DROP IF EXISTS, CREATE OR ALTER, CMINE, TRIM, STRING_SPLIT, STRING_AGG, DATEDIFF_BIG, AT TIME ZONE, temporal tables and SQL Graph. If time will permit, the seminar will also cover the fundamentals of more specialized query constructs like PIVOT, UNPIVOT, grouping sets and window functions.

Know your T-SQL querying fundamentals well, and then tackling advanced challenges will be so much easier.

## Speaker(s): Ted Neward
## Title: Busy .NET Developer's Guide to Multiparadigmatic Design in C#
## Description:
### C++ was widely denigrated as a "hopelessly complex" language with "way too many moving parts", and in truth, it was a language made up of three dominant paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, and meta-programmatic. C#, by contrast, has five dominant paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, meta-programmatic, functional and now dynamic. (Visual Basic doesn't fare much better on this score.) If we're to use these new multi-paradigm languages successfully, we'd better have a good idea of what the paradigms are, what a language paradigm is, and what the different paradigms are in the languages we know and love.

## Title: Speed Up R Solutions with Azure ML
## Description:
### Using Azure ML to drag and drop algorithms and running in with cloud resources can be a quick way to create a solution. Unfortunately, the deployment of an Azure ML solution is more complicated as it requires that you deploy a Web Service, rather than run a SQL Server stored procedure.  Learn how you can take the solution created in Azure ML and transform it to R code to be deployed in SQL Server. This technique will speed your development and deployment, especially for testing large datasets, and is a great way to start getting up to speed with advanced analytics.

## Speaker(s): Douglas Barrett
## Title: Positioning IT for Success Through Automation
## Description:
### Since the dawn of analytics projects, IT teams have wrestled with the concept of “time to value”.  Projects often die before being delivered, or fizzle over time because data warehouses and business systems can be slow to build and difficult to evolve as data and business requirements change.  

Additionally, while business users are heavily invested in getting the information they need to make decisions as quickly as possible, they seldom have the technical knowledge to ask for the “right data” for the decision the first time. Agile projects are designed for this challenge – start with what we know, build a prototype, socialize, adapt and refine. But, unfortunately, delays associated with traditional tools and projects, such as those relying on ETL tools, can further exasperate and ultimately drive business users to work around IT and start experimenting with their own BI tools.

Organizations are best served with a single, persistent, enterprise data repository (data warehouse) that will travel with the business as its evolves rather than short-sighted, decentralized development and desktop efforts. So how do we empower our skilled IT development teams to be more agile and deliver useful solutions to the business sooner?
Automation can help teams greatly speed up agile project development and turn “time to value” into an asset when measuring the success of your IT organization.  

In this session, you’ll learn how data warehouse automation can help IT teams to:
• Speed up project delivery by leveraging flexible design and code patterns backed by metadata
• Automatically generate documentation to aid support and reduce development backlog
• Payback technical debt that is typically lost within agile projects

Come and learn how automating the design, development and ongoing operation of data warehouse projects is setting hundreds of IT organizations worldwide, large and small, in a stronger position to deliver to the business and make better use of their resources.

## Speaker(s): Paul Andrew
## Title: Working with Azure Data Factory & Creating Custom Activities
## Description:
### In this session, we’ll go beyond the Azure Data Factory copy activity normally presented using the limited Azure Portal wizard. Extract and load are never the hard parts of the pipeline. It is the ability to transform, manipulate and clean our data that normally requires more effort. Sadly, this task doesn’t come so naturally to Azure Data Factory as an orchestration tool so we need to rely on its custom activities to break out the C# or VB to perform such tasks. Using Visual Studio, we’ll look at how to do exactly that and see what’s involved in Azure to utilise this pipeline extensibility feature. What handles the compute for the compiled .Net code and how can does this get deployed by ADF? With real world use cases, we’ll learn how to fight back against those poorly formed CSV files and what we can do if Excel files are our only data source. Plus, lots of useful tips and tricks along the way when working with this emerging technology.

Today, a customer seeking to deploy an enterprise scale EDW application with the pre-requisite features such as security, scalability, availability, authentication/authorization etc; has a plethora of analytics, data, storage and compute options in Azure. This diversity of offerings presents challenges in picking the right components and architecture that are proven to be enterprise ready in capabilities and interoperability, and easy to implement as an end to end system, in a timely manner.  

The Technical Reference Implementation (TRI) presented in this talk is deployable software that integrates a set of Data technologies that are well tested for enterprise requirements. The entire solution can be deployed in a few hours – as opposed to the current norm of weeks. This enables users to accelerate the build-out of their production grade applications.

The TRI packages various cloud components with associated job managers and monitors that orchestrate the interoperability between components, enable the end to end data pipeline flow, monitor all key operations, accommodating for the rough edges in the components. The deployment ships with all the relevant code and detailed documentation. This allows customers to focus on their main goal of running their enterprise-critical business applications at scale and efficiently in the cloud.

In this talk, we will explain the architecture and components of the TRI and its end to end operation from data ingestion, large scale data warehousing, BI and Reporting. 
We will complement the talk with the demo of the TRI.

# Optimize SQL Server: Become a Query Tuning Master
#### [Back to calendar](#id-749)
Event Date: 01-11-2017 13:30 - Category: Partner Session (75 minutes) - Track: Perform
## Speaker(s): Rajnikant Tandel, Anup Gopinathan
## Title: Optimize SQL Server: Become a Query Tuning Master
## Description:
### In any given SQL Server instance, there are likely 8 to 10 queries or stored procedures that are responsible for 80 to 90 percent of the poorly tuned activity that you see throughout the day. If you can identify these problem queries and tune them, you can make a significant impact on the overall performance of your server. A key component of overall application performance tuning is query tuning. Writing queries in an efficient manner, and making sure they execute in the most optimal way possible, is always a challenge.  This presentation will explain few scenarios of tuning the queries including before and after performance differences. Scenarios such as, use of SQL server 2016 in-memory tables over normal table or explicit transaction over auto commit.

## Speaker(s): David Maxwell
## Title: Targeting Wait Statistics with Extended Events and DMVs
## Description:
### When troubleshooting overall server performance, wait statistics are a great place to start. But when your SQL Server hosts a complex set of workloads, it can be difficult to narrow down which queries are causing the most wait, and what types of wait they are causing. Fortunately, SQL Server provides easy ways for targeting which queries are causing you the most wait time. In this session, we’ll learn how to use both Extended Events, and Dynamic Management Views new to SQL Server 2016 for examining wait statistics at a query level, rather than at the server level. We’ll analyze poorly performing queries using a combination of methods and show how to quickly narrow down what SQL Server is waiting for, and why.

## Speaker(s): Erin Stellato
## Title: Query Store and Automatic Tuning in SQL Server
## Description:
### One of the most highly anticipated new features in the SQL Server 2016 release was Query Store. It's referred to as the "flight data recorder" for SQL Server because it tracks query information over time – including the text, the plan, and execution statistics. The addition of wait statistics information – tracked for each query plan – in SQL Server 2017 makes Query Store a tool that every data professional needs to know how to use, whether you're new to troubleshooting or someone who's been doing it for years. When you include the new Automatic Tuning feature in SQL Server 2017, suddenly it seems like you might spend less time fighting fires and more time enjoying a lunch break that’s not at your desk. 

In this session, we'll walk through Query Store with a series of demos designed to help you understand how you can immediately start to use it once you’ve upgraded to SQL Server 2016 or 2017. We'll review the different options for Query Store, look at the data collected (including wait stats!), check out how to force a plan, and dive into how you can leverage Automatic Plan Correction and reduce the time you spend on Severity 1 calls fighting fires.  It’s time to embrace the future and learn how to make troubleshooting easier using the plethora of intelligent data natively captured in SQL Server and SQL Azure Database.

Co-presenter: Dejan Krakovic, a Senior Software Engineer from Microsoft who helped develop Query Store and originally implement it for those 2 million (!) user databases in SQL Azure.

## Speaker(s): Gianluca Sartori
## Title: Responding to Extended Events in Near Real-Time
## Description:
### Extended Events provide deep insight into SQL Server's behavior and allow us to gather information not available by other means. However, compared to other technologies such as SQL Trace and Event Notifications, Extended Events don't seem to provide a way to react to the events as soon as they happen.

In this session we will see how the Extended Events streaming API can be used to process events in a near real-time fashion. We will demonstrate how this technology enables new possibilities to solve real world problems, such as capturing and notifying deadlocks or blocking sessions. We will also offer a different approach to analyzing captured events, without shredding XML files.

## Title: Dive in to the Azure Data Lake
## Description:
### Azure Data Lake has two products that make Hadoop easy and accessible for the Azure and Microsoft Developer.  

Azure Data Lake Store allows storing of massive data without setting up name nodes, worrying about partitioning, or wondering how much space you’ll eventually need.  Pay for what you use, use what you pay for.  It also exposes a Hadoop compatible API, so you can use popular products on the data stored there.  In this session, we’ll see how we can use Storm and Hive over data in ADLS.

Azure Data Lake Analytics allows us to write analytics jobs using a combination of SQL and C#. Want to see a SQL script with a C# code behind file?  Want to see how you can choose your degree of parallelism for each individual job run (think MAXDOP but for ADLA)? Want to see how you can apply your SQL Server Optimizer skills to ADLA? This session will show how you can harness the power of C# with the inherent parallelism of SQL.

Finally, we’ll discuss real world examples of how the product can be implemented and optimized. Bring the power of big analytics to your organization with little overhead.

## Speaker(s): Walt Ritscher
## Title: From Dull to Dazzling: How Visualization Enhances Data Comprehension
## Description:
### Our applications and devices are gathering and storing data at unprecedented levels. Once the information is in our data centers we need tools to help us understand the hidden knowledge contained in that stockpile. We’ve got business intelligence tools that can help but at some point in the data analytics cycle you need to show results to the stakeholder. That’s when choosing the correct visual representation of the data becomes vital. Do it wrong and the data is merely wrapped in pretty graphics; do it right and the user perceives their information in clear and meaningful patterns. There has been an explosion of research on ways to present data in graphical form in the last decade. This is often called Data Visualization or Information Graphics and it is becoming a must have skill for UI developers. This session explores the overall visual concepts that make data easier to grasp. Do you know the best way to show data to your users, so that the information is clear and understandable? Come to this session to learn how to make your data shine.

## Title: Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!
## Description:
### Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works, but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool.
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool!
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events. 
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king!

## Title: BimlCatalog: Your Open Source Runtime and Orchestration Solution for Biml Projects
## Description:
### By now, many of you have used Biml to generate staging solutions. Some of you have built metadata stores to automate dimensional or data vault warehouses. Now you’re ready to take your Biml solution into production.

Before you release it into the wild, you will need to extend the default auditing and logging behavior of SSIS to capture meaningful audit and debug information. Of course, you can invest tremendous time and effort to build your own, but why not just reuse our free open source framework with provided BimlCatalog database, custom components, documentation, and extensive Biml samples?

This framework is robust and able to restart from the last failure skipping already loaded packages. As an example, if one of your 50 parallelized table load packages fails, the following execution will skip the packages that succeeded and resume at the next package.

In this session, you will learn how to integrate the framework into your solution and learn how to include:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Row Counts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Row Errors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persist Variables and Parameters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Package and Task Execution Duration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Package and Task Execution Errors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

This session and the accompanying code will provide you with everything you need to easily implement and maintain this orchestration framework in your own solution for free.

## Title: Azure SQL Databases: A Guided Tour
## Description:
### You know about the cloud but you’re not there yet. Is it hard? Is it easy? How do you get started? Come to this session and see for yourself. We’ll start with nothing and end up with a deployed Azure SQL Database. We’ll even run a quick PowerBI report and enable Geo-Redundant Disaster Recovery with a few clicks.

The goal is to take the mystery out, to show the capabilities and get you thinking about what going to the cloud could look like and what it can do for you and your company. I believe the future belongs to those who have this knowledge and know where to apply it.

This will be nearly PowerPoint free and we’ll log into my Azure Portal and build out an environment from scratch and learn as we go. We’ll migrate data from an “on-premises” database into our SQL DB and we’ll query it. You’ll leave with an understanding of the capabilities, some resource links outlining what we did and hopefully some curiosity to see what else is up there in the cloud as you start exploring.

## Speaker(s): Sean McCown
## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Description:
### Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 
Here you’ll learn: 
• The most useful regular expression commands. 
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions. 
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you. 
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

## Title: Understanding the Transaction Log For Faster Throughput
## Description:
### Does your application suffer from performance problems even though you followed best practices on schema design? Have you looked at your transaction log? 
There's no doubt about it, the transaction log is treated like a poor cousin. The poor thing does not receive much love. The transaction log, however, is a very essential and misunderstood part of your database. There will be a team of developers creating an absolutely awesome elegant design the likes of which have never been seen before, but the leave the transaction log using default settings. It's as if it doesn't matter, an afterthought, a relic of the platform architecture.
In this session, you will learn to appreciate how the transaction log works and how you can improve the performance of your applications by making the right architectural choices. From understanding the internals we can design for faster recovery and batch processes and ironically a smaller transaction log!

## Title: Modernizing ETL with Azure Data Lake: Hyperscale, Multi-format, Multi-platform, and Intelligent
## Description:
### Increasingly, customers looking to modernize their analytics needs are exploring the Data Lake approach. They are challenged by poorly-integrated technologies, a variety of data formats, and inconvenient data types. We explore a modern ETL pipeline through the lens of Azure Data Lake. This approach allows pipelines to scale to thousands of nodes instantly and lets pipelines integrate code written in .NET, Python, and R. This degree of extensibility allows pipelines to handle formats such as CSV, XML, JSON, Images, etc. Finally, we explore how the next generation of ETL scenarios are enabled by integrating intelligence in the data layer in the form of built-in cognitive capabilities.

## Speaker(s): Meagan Longoria
## Title: Transitioning from Integration Services to Azure Data Factory
## Description:
### Although SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and Azure Data Factory (ADF) are both used for data management processes in the Microsoft Data Platform, they are rather different tools. SSIS performs data transformation and requires a SQL Agent job or another application to schedule and execute it.

## Speaker(s): Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Three Steps to Lasting Encryption
## Description:
### You’ve encrypted your data! You’ve used the latest techniques. It’s strong. It’s safe. You’re done, right? Not so fast. Encryption gets weaker with age - keys are lost, algorithms are cracked, techniques become obsolete. In time, the system breaks down, rendering your data either irretrievable or unprotected.

To keep your encryption at full strength, you need to add three practices to your regular maintenance schedule. First, backup your keys frequently and securely to ensure you can always retrieve the data you’ve encrypted. Second, rotate your keys regularly to limit your exposure due to a lost or compromised key. Third, add an encryption key management solution (like Azure Key Vault) to make managing large numbers of keys easier or to enable someone else to manage the keys. In this session, we’ll discuss how you can implement each of these practices in your own environment.

## Speaker(s): Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day
## Description:
### You’re busy. You don’t have time to check the security of your systems all the time, right? It’s not like anyone has added a user that you don’t know about. And no one would create a database and add all logins to the db_owner role. And of course, no one would ever think of setting the TRUSTWORTHY property on a database... right?

Things like that happen on a daily basis, poking holes in even the most well-secured database. Those holes are just waiting for someone to find them. That someone could be you, or it could be an attacker probing for a way to get data from your company.

In this session, we will explore how to create reports that are quick to review so you can find the holes before someone else does - without interfering with the rest of your day. Along the way, you'll also learn where to find security-related information in SQL Server's metadata and logs to allow you to customize and extend the reports to meet your company's unique needs.

## Speaker(s): Aaron Cutshall
## Title: "There Be Whales Here!" -- Big Data in SQL Server
## Description:
### Due to varying definitions of Big Data which confuse data volume and data organization, the common perception is that Big Data requires the use of Hadoop, MongoDB, or another NoSQL database.  SQL Server can easily store and manipulate very large volumes of data and perform quite well provided the database is properly set up and tuned.  In this session we'll cover some of the definitions and misconceptions of Big Data, look at some Big Data solutions that went horribly wrong and review a case where Big Data was successfully implemented in SQL Server.  Finally, we'll take a peek under the covers to see how SQL Server best handles Big Data through proper data models, table designs, performance tuning, and T-SQL techniques.

## Speaker(s): Kendra Little
## Title: When Partitioning Indexes Hurts Performance (and How to Fix It)
## Description:
### Table partitioning is a fantastic tool to help you manage tables with skyrocketing rowcounts. SQL Server 2016 SP1 made table partitioning available in Standard Edition, so you may be planning to add partitioning to your database.

But some queries may get slower after you partition your tables: the SQL Server optimizer doesn’t always use indexes the same way after those indexes are partitioned into chunks.

This session teaches you to use execution plans to troubleshoot regressed queries using partitioned tables. You will learn what “non-aligned” indexes are, how to tell how many partitions a query is really using, and see options for TSQL and indexing changes to speed up your queries.

## Title: DAX Best Practices
## Description:
### As with any other language, you can write good DAX but you can also write bad DAX. Good DAX works fine, it is fast and reliable and can be updated easily. Bad DAX, on the other hand is… well, just bad.

In this session, we will show several DAX formulas, taken from our experience as consultants and teachers, analyzing (very briefly) the performances and looking for errors, or for different ways of writing them. As you will see, writing good DAX means following some simple rules and, of course, understanding well how evaluation contexts work!

## Speaker(s): Stuart Moore
## Title: Get on the Azure Service Bus
## Description:
### You have a carefully looked after on premises production database, but you need to connect to it from an Azure hosted application. How can you do that without compromising security or having to provision VPNs? Your new application MUST be up for customers 24/7, is it possible to decouple this from your database to allow for patching and maintenance windows?

 Azure Service Bus may be the solution you're looking for. 

On-Premise Service Bus architectures have been around for a while, but setting one up, maintaining it, and scaling it have been a full time job in themselves. Now with Azure Service Bus, setting up requires just a few clicks, scaling takes a few more and maintenance is done for you.

We'll cover common design patterns, what Azure Service Bus can offer you, setting it up, configuring for performance and availability, and showing how your clients can interact with it.

## Speaker(s): Artur Kiulian
## Title: Future of Work: Human Assistance in the Intelligent Workplace
## Description:
### Big companies are trying to outsource their processes to machines, or at least break them apart into pieces that can be automated. This may be a major concern to an unskilled layer of workers. It can also be a stimulus for spending those saved costs on more qualified specialists in the missing areas instead.

But how do machines make certain decisions? Even Google engineers are out of touch with how their algorithms work now thanks to the system’s complexity, which could prevent us from completely trusting AI. To clear up this issue Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently funded research to make new a kind of artificial intelligence algorithms that can properly explain themselves and their conclusions.

And what better way to know something than to ask directly? Conversation as a technology has been creeping its way into the picture for many years. It seems now we are finally reaching a state where it can become usable to some extent. This trend will set apart companies that are leveraging intelligent assistance from those that are still trying to better processes by simply hiring more humans.

## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: "But It Worked in Development!" - 3 Hard Performance Problems
## Description:
### Warning: this is not an introductory session. These are going to be tough problems.

You've been performance tuning queries and indexes for a few years, but lately, you've been running into problems you can't explain. Could it be RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE, THREADPOOL, or lock escalation? These problems only pop up under heavy load or concurrency, so they're very hard to detect in a development environment.

In a very fast-paced session, I'll show these three performance problems pop up under load. I won't be able to teach you how to fix them for good - not inside the span of 75 minutes - but at least you'll be able to recognize the symptoms when they strike, and I'll show you where to go to learn more.

# SQL Server 2016 Always On AGs:  Perf, Internals, Lessons Learned
#### [Back to calendar](#id-749)

## Speaker(s): Jimmy May
## Title: SQL Server 2016 Always On AGs:  Perf, Internals, Lessons Learned
## Description:
### Always On Availability Groups (AGs) were introduced in SQL Server 2012. AGs significantly expanded our HA/DR options. However, in both SQL 2012 and SQL 2014 two limitations were extant in the code—both Network Transport and Log Redo significantly compromised performance. In SQL Server 2016, these limitations have been significantly improved. My work shows enhancements of 7x – 10x, allowing over ½GB/s (4Gb/s) across the wire. These improvements expand solutions options for Tier 1 OLTP and Data Warehouse workloads, Tier 1 and Tier 2 consolidation, and more. This presentation explains the improvements, characterizes the new solutions, and documents how commodity servers and modern non-shared in-server flash storage demonstrate the profound contrast between SQL Server 2014 vs. 2016. Doing so moves the performance bottleneck from the SQL Server codebase to the CPU—exactly where it belongs.

# Optimize SQL Server: Become a Query Tuning Master
#### [Back to calendar](#id-749)
Event Date: 03-11-2017 09:30 - Category: Partner Session (75 minutes) - Track: Perform
## Speaker(s): Rajnikant Tandel, Anup Gopinathan
## Title: Optimize SQL Server: Become a Query Tuning Master
## Description:
### In any given SQL Server instance, there are likely 8 to 10 queries or stored procedures that are responsible for 80 to 90 percent of the poorly tuned activity that you see throughout the day. If you can identify these problem queries and tune them, you can make a significant impact on the overall performance of your server. A key component of overall application performance tuning is query tuning. Writing queries in an efficient manner, and making sure they execute in the most optimal way possible, is always a challenge.  This presentation will explain few scenarios of tuning the queries including before and after performance differences. Scenarios such as, use of SQL server 2016 in-memory tables over normal table or explicit transaction over auto commit.

## Title: Who's on First? SQL Server statistics & Dynamic Power BI Visuals!
## Description:
### What will happen when a BI Expert is analyzing statistics and a Performance Tuner is creating Power BI reports based on that analysis?  A dynamic learning experience from two experienced professionals.
 
The SQL Server optimizer uses distribution statistics when creating execution plans. Statistics are used to provide the optimizer with estimations for the best way to process the query and hopefully optimize performance.
 
Power BI is a powerful tool that has been released in the last few years that helps you visualize your information to help make informative decisions with rich visualization.
 
In this session, we will show you how SQL Server uses statistics to create the execution plan and Power BI to visualize that statistical distribution; with a TWIST.  Roles will be reversed to show a dynamic and interactive learning experience helping users with two different concepts in one exciting session!

## Speaker(s): Tim Mitchell
## Title: SSIS and the Cloud: Yes, They Can Get Along
## Description:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) has been around since the cloud was just a term to describe the weather. SSIS is great at handling most any on-premises data load need, but that doesn't mean that it can't be used for cloud or on-prem/cloud hybrid architectures. With the flexibility in its legacy behaviors and the new cloud-specific tasks and components, Integration Services is versatile enough to wrangle both traditional on-prem and cloud-based ETL needs.

In this session, we will cover how SQL Server Integration Services can play well with the cloud. We'll review and demonstrate how existing SSIS tasks and components can be used for cloud or hybrid load scenarios, and will walk through some of the newest tools built specifically for cloud endpoints. We will also discuss the role SSIS plays in the enterprise alongside other cloud data integration tools, including Azure Data Factory (ADF).

## Speaker(s): Davide Mauri
## Title: Dapper: The MicroORM That Will Change Your Life
## Description:
### ORM or Stored Procedures? Code First or Database First? Ad-Hoc Queries? Impedance Mismatch? If you're a developer or you are a DBA working with developers you have heard all this terms at least once in your life…and usually in the middle of a strong discussion, debating about one or the other. 
Well, thanks to StackOverflow's Dapper, all these fights are finished. Dapper is a blazing fast microORM that allows developers to map SQL queries to classes automatically, leaving (and encouraging) the usage of stored procedures, parameterized statements and all the good stuff that SQL Server offers (JSON and TVP are supported too!) 
In this session I'll show how to use Dapper in your projects from the very basis to some more complex usages that will help you to create *really fast* applications without the burden of huge and complex ORMs. 
The days of Impedance Mismatch are finally over!

## Speaker(s): Ola Hallengren
## Title: Performance Monitoring Using Extended Events, DMVs & Query Store
## Description:
### Extended Events, Dynamic Management Views (DMVs), and Query Store are powerful and lightweight tools that gives you a lot of data when analyzing performance problems.  All this is great news for database administrators. The challenge is which tool to use for which problems and how to combine the data.

Imagine a scenario where you are getting timeouts from a business critical application, the users are complaining, and you are trying to understand what is happening. You have data from XEvents, you are looking in the execution related DMVs, and now you are trying to find the query in Query Store. How do you put it all together?

In this session you will learn techniques for combining the data from these tools, to gain great insight, when analyzing performance problems. We will look at common real-world problems, do the troubleshooting step by step, and visualize the data using PowerBI.

## Title: Take Each Day and Work on Making it Better
## Description:
### As an IT professional, and in the BI solution space specifically, we often speak of aggregate functions and analysis and visualizations along the way to creating a user experience in support of making better business decisions.  But what if you turn some of those concepts on you and your career?  Over 5 years ago my life took a drastic turn through an unfortunate accident.  I quickly learned how to take each day and work on making it better than the one before and have used that to accelerate to new heights in my career – all while losing my ability to stand or walk.  Along the way people have commented that I’m an inspiration or that I help motivate them.  All I respond to them in return is that I’m just an average guy.

Come listen to my story – perhaps you can learn to be average like me, and along the way learn how average can win every time.

Event Date: 03-11-2017 14:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Support
## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Implementing Row Level Security in SQL Server
## Description:
### Since the early days of SQL Server, it has been possible to use basic security measures to allow (and disallow) user access to any object in a database, and even limit access to a given column. A more difficult task has been to limit access to the individual rows in a table. This has made application development more complex because whereas most every user may have access to a table like HR.Employee, not every employee will have access to every employee's data. In this session I will cover several techniques to limit access to rows, from methods that have existed since early versions of SQL Server, to the new Row Level Security feature in SQL Server 2016. If time permits, an overview of Dynamic Data Masking will be included, since it is a related technology.

## Speaker(s): William Durkin
## Title: SQL Server Replication: A Deeper Look Under the Covers
## Description:
### Replication is one of the oldest data distribution technologies inside SQL Server (available since version 6.0). The age of replication shows in the management and troubleshooting tools (or lack thereof). In this half-day session, we will dig into some real-world implementations and see how to manage deployments, performance problems and troubleshooting scenarios. 

We will look at: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considerations for topology choices in a replication deployment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to keep replication running smoothly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to identify internal performance issues in replicating data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to approach schema modifications in a replicated database&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Approaches for troubleshooting errors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uses for replication in modern SQL Server environments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
You will leave this session with a deeper understanding of the internals of replication. You will also be confident in identifying and triaging issues connected with replication systems.

# Behavior-Driven Development and Test Automation: Agile Enablement for DW and BI Teams
#### [Back to calendar](#id-749)

## Speaker(s): Cher Fox, Lynn Winterboer
## Title: Behavior-Driven Development and Test Automation: Agile Enablement for DW and BI Teams
## Description:
### Regardless of whether your data warehousing (DW)/business intelligence (BI) team is dedicated to Scrum, is a fan of Kanban, or is focused on XP, “Agile” in any form calls for small increments of potentially deployable results – which means that clear requirements and QA are essential. As we develop these small increments, we need to not only test the new development, but also regression test what we’ve already built. Our test suite grows larger with each iteration, and reactive, manual testing quickly becomes infeasible. Agile requires that we specify small, testable requirements and automate our tests so that regression testing doesn’t become a development bottleneck. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and test automation are key practices that allow data warehouse and business intelligence teams to be more successful in their agile journeys. While there are lots of requirements and test practices, and automation tools, out there for software development teams to leverage, very few are targeted to data-related development and testing. Learn about essential agile test foundations, BDD, and data-focused test automation technologies to help data warehousing and business intelligence teams get a leg up on these important agile practices. 

This session will cover:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why test automation is important for agile DW/BI teams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why DW/BI teams are not automating their tests today&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The path to data-focused test automation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Behavior-Driven Development for clear specification and automatable tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where to start and what tests to automate first&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demo of a simple test automation tool that any DW/BI team can build and use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

## Speaker(s): Jay Robinson
## Title: Better Performance in the SqlClient Namespace
## Description:
### Developing an application that will scale well requires a holistic approach. A routine in C# or Visual Basic may perform well in isolation, yet have a negative effect on the application as a whole. This can be especially challenging with data access code, in which the developer is often faced with dependence on a primary record - one column, one row, one table, one database.

In this session, we will address the performance of data access code through careful analysis of several features of the SqlClient namespace in the .NET Framework. We will explore how common approaches can appear to work sufficiently, yet mask underlying problems that can lead to overall application issues.

Selected topics include:
- Connection pooling strategies
- Nuances of the SqlDataReader class
- Alternatives for asynchronous execution
- Effective use of the SqlBulkCopy class

Following this session, attendees should be better prepared to develop scalable solutions that depend on the SqlClient namespace.

## Speaker(s): Arvind Shyamsundar, Shreya Verma
## Title: Building a Graph Database Application with SQL Server 2017 and Azure SQL Database
## Description:
### SQL Server and Azure SQL DB are bringing intelligence closer to where data lives with many new features. One such feature introduced in SQL Server 2017 and Azure SQL DB is the ability to describe a Graph, store data in form of nodes and edges making up a graph. This allows real world scenarios such as recommendation systems, fraud detection, basket analysis to be implemented more efficiently with SQL technologies. Learn more about the typical use cases for Graphs, the feature itself and future plans from the engineering team! We will use demos to explain the new syntax and discuss learnings from real-world customer engagements.

## Speaker(s): Bob Pusateri, David Klee
## Title: Linux Administration for the SQL Server DBA
## Description:
### Times are certainly changing with Microsoft’s recent announcement to adopt the Linux operating system with the release of SQL Server 2017, and you should be prepared to support it. But, what is Linux? Why run your critical databases on an unfamiliar operating system? How do you handle the basics, such as backing up to a network share or add additional drives for data, logs, and tempdb files?

This introductory session will help seasoned SQL Server DBAs understand the basics of Linux and how it differs from Windows, all the way from basic management to performance monitoring. By the end of the session, you will be able to launch your own Linux-based SQL Server instance on a production-ready VM.

## Speaker(s): Gabriel Villa, Marc Beacom
## Title: Two Guys and a Transformation: ETL Best Practices and Techniques
## Description:
### ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) is the backbone of any data project and can be upwards of 70% or more of the effort. The tools you have access to allow you to make progress in a hurry. However, are you implementing best practices and techniques that will scale to the demands you need? Or will you be refactoring far too quickly than you should to meet performance requirements?
Gain helpful insights from decades of lessons learned and walk away with best practices you can implement in your own ETL solution.

# Tuning In-Memory Indexes 
#### [Back to calendar](#id-749)
Event Date: 03-11-2017 15:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Build
## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Tuning In-Memory Indexes 
## Description:
### SQL Server’s memory-optimized tables support two new kinds of indexes: hash and range. How are these indexes different than the B-tree indexes on your disk-based tables and how do they help in-memory OLTP achieve such blazing-fast performance? 

You'll learn how to:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the internal structure of hash and range indexes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the pros, cons, and best practices for both types of indexes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine the metadata that shows how the indexes on memory-optimized tables are being used&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Event Date: 03-11-2017 15:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Support
## Speaker(s): Carlos L Chacon
## Title: Measure Performance Through Baselines
## Description:
### You get a ticket or email indicating there is a problem with the database and are asked to review.  How do you know there is a problem?  Baselines.  Without a set known measurements to compare against it will be impossible to know whether your change is helping.  This session reviews the process for collecting information about your SQL Server so you can compare current processes with historical processes.  Once you understand the current behavior of the database, you can measure the impact of any change.  This session will review ways to set up the collection of performance information and make it available for review later.

# Adaptive Query Plans? What’s Up With That?
#### [Back to calendar](#id-749)
Event Date: 03-11-2017 15:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Perform
## Speaker(s): Gail Shaw
## Title: Adaptive Query Plans? What’s Up With That?
## Description:
### One of the new features announced for SQL Server 2017 is Adaptive Query Plans, query plans that can change after the query starts executing.

This session will show why this is a radical departure from the way that things have worked until now and how it can improve the performance of some query forms. We’ll look at the places where adaptive query plans work and compare the performance of queries using adaptive query plans to see just what kind of improvement it can make.

## Speaker(s): Sourabh Agarwal
## Title: Effectively Troubleshooting Latency and Failover of Always On 
## Description:
### Two of the biggest customer issue surrounding Always On Availability Groups are latency and failover issues. Troubleshooting both of these issues can be a challenge and time consuming. In order to effectively troubleshooting these issues data needs to be collected and analyzed from different servers and replicas. Things get further complicated by the fact that there are multiple logs which needs to be looked at and that these logs are in different time zone formats. 

In this session, we will cover:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The internals of SQL Server Always On&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identifying and detecting latency and failover issues with Always On&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Artifacts and data pointers available to troubleshoot latency and failover issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tips and Tricks to troubleshoot Always On availability groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New enhancements which make troubleshooting Latency and Failover issues easier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
