## Speaker(s): Glenn Berry
## Title: Dr. DMV: How to Use DMVs to Diagnose Performance Problems
## Description:
### SQL Server 2005 introduced Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) that allow you to see exactly what is happening inside your SQL Server instances and databases with much more detail than ever before. SQL Server 2016 adds even more capability in this area. You can discover your top wait types, most CPU intensive stored procedures, find missing indexes, and identify unused indexes, to name just a few examples. This session (which is applicable to SQL 2005-2016), presents and explains over seventy DMV queries that you can quickly and easily use to detect and diagnose performance issues in your environment. 

If you have ever been responsible for a mission critical database, you have probably been faced with a high stress, emergency situation where a database issue is causing unacceptable application performance, resulting in angry users and hovering managers and executives. If this hasn't happened to you yet, thank your lucky stars, but start getting prepared for your time in the hot seat. This session will show you how to use DMV queries to quickly detect and diagnose the problem, starting at the server and instance level, and then progressing down to the database and object level. 

This session will show you how to properly analyze and interpret the results of every single query in the set, along with lots of information on how to properly configure your instance and databases.

## Title: What's New for BI in SQL Server 2016?
## Description:
### SQL Server 2016 offers many new BI features! Are you ready? In this workshop, we explore the many changes across the stack through a series of demos and discussions about the pros and cons of each feature, migration steps, and practical advice for implementing these features. 

We start by introducing changes to Integration Services that expand your connectivity, development, and deployment options. We also review the improvements to Analysis Services models that provide you with even more flexibility in the design process, support more complex modeling scenarios, and improve performance. Then we tour the Reporting Services modernization for development, new web access, and mobile reporting. 

Throughout this workshop, we also review options for integrating JSON, R, and PolyBase into BI processes. Whether you are a BI architect or developer, this workshop provides you with the information you need to prepare for SQL Server 2016.

# AlmostOn: Troubleshooting Clustered Implementations of SQL Server

Event Date: 24-10-2016 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: AlmostOn: Troubleshooting Clustered Implementations of SQL Server
## Description:
### Server down situations are stressful for everyone. Every second counts as you struggle to get things get things running again. Highly available SQL Server architectures are often complex; they can experience and sometimes even cause outages – especially if they are not implemented properly. Troubleshooting clustered instances (FCIs) and availability groups (AGs) is a skill anyone who deploys these features should have. However, this is a difficult skill set to acquire since downtime in the real world administers the test first and the education afterwards. 

In addition, FCIs and AGs are tightly coupled solutions utilizing a Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC), networking, Active Directory, DNS, and more. Without understanding these things, troubleshooting becomes nearly impossible. 

This full-day pre-con will teach you approaches for dealing with real-world problems related to the different clustered configurations of SQL Server whether they are FCIs or AGs. You’ll learn about the tools and utilities you can use for diagnosis, common failure scenarios, and solutions, avoiding problems by being proactive, and more. Each student will also gain hands on experience via one or more lab scenarios using their own laptop connected to Web-based virtual machines where learning translates into action to bring a broken HA environment online.

If you are responsible for supporting FCIs or AGs, this session is one which will make you the hero when everyone needs one.

## Speaker(s): Kendra Little
## Title: SQL Server Index Formulas: Problems and Solutions
## Description:
### Every SQL Server developer must know the essentials of clustered and non-clustered index design to build fast and reliable applications. You need scripts to show when a new non-clustered index, filtered index, or indexed view will improve performance on a live SQL Server workload, and the skills to design the best index. 

In this example-packed full-day session, you will work through a series of problems and solutions to learn how to create and tune indexes. You will learn how to select and order key columns, when included columns help, when to use special indexes, and when to drop indexes. You will see how SQL Server 2016’s new Query Store feature offers you new tools for improving your indexes, and how Query Store compares to index dynamic management views. 

You'll leave with all the scripts for the problems and solutions covered in the course, plus a set of additional exercises to keep building your index skills.

## Speaker(s): David Klee
## Title: The Complete Primer to SQL Server Virtualization
## Description:
### Your SQL Servers are probably virtualized at this point, but do you feel you have lost that control over the infrastructure that you used to have when they were physical servers? Do the virtual SQL Servers “feel” slower after they were virtualized? When architected and managed with SQL Server in mind, this added layer will help improve the SQL Server’s availability and ability to change with the business, but only when executed properly.

This all-day interactive and hypervisor-agnostic session is designed to help data professionals learn more about virtualization and infrastructure, and discover how this new layer can be used to improve the management, availability, and performance of their databases. You will be exposed to all layers of virtualization underneath the SQL Server, from the storage to the hypervisor, and will discover many useful tips and tricks to tuning the database layer to boost performance and availability. The following topics will be addressed during the session:
•	virtualization and infrastructure fundamentals
•	the SQL Server Virtual Machine
•	networking, support, and licensing
•	High Availability and Disaster Recovery
•	performance investigation and tuning of the entire stack.

### Data is everywhere. It’s coming from every device, web page, application, and system in your organization. How do you prepare for it? How do you share the data with the end-users that need access to the data? How do you secure the data? 

In this session we will explain and demonstrate how to build out an efficient and effective Data Platform that will scale across your entire organization.  We will present on-premises, hybrid, and cloud-based options. You will leave with the tools needed to develop, deploy, and manage the entire solution.  Here is a look at what will be covered.
 
Preparing your organization for a Business Intelligence Solution

We will cover what this looks like for your organization. From on-premises, to cloud and hybrid approaches. We will take a look at some sample topologies as well as look at how Office 365 fits into the picture. If you go the Office 365 approach, you will also need to know how authentication will be effected.

Building a Data Warehouse

Data warehouses still have their place. You also have options in how you approach it. We will look at some of the different technology available to you and why you should consider having a data warehouse.

Loading a Data Warehouse

So, you’ve decided to have a data warehouse! How do you get data into it? We will look at how SQL Server Integration Services fits in your organization and how it can help you to get data where it needs to be. We will also briefly talk about Azure Data Factory.

Building a Semantic Model

A semantic model really helps to describe your data and allows for further analytics on your data. You have options here as well! We will look at self-service options, such as Power Pivot and Power BI Desktop, as well as enterprise options with tabular and multidimensional in Analysis Services.

Sharing and Visualizing your Data

After you have your data and your semantic model, you can start to have fun! We will look at the Microsoft offerings for reporting. This will include the new Reporting Services 2016, Power BI and Excel.

## Description:
### You put a lot of time into managing your databases, but MSDB often flies under the radar or only gets backed up. There are a ton of things that get stored in MSDB, so how are you supposed to know what all those items are? More importantly, how do you manage the data that is getting stored in there and keep it from growing out of control? We will take an in-depth look at all the SQL features that put data in MSDB and the best approach to managing that data.  You will walk away with scripts you can use to automate the grooming of MSDB.

## Description:
### Your ideas are only as good as your ability to describe them to others.
 
As technology professionals, our tech skills need to be at their peak. However, we often lack the communication skills to describe technical concepts to others, including business users, executives, or even other technology professionals. In this session, veteran IT professional and Microsoft Data Platform MVP, Mike Hillwig, will show you a handful of skills that are essential in communicating with people outside of the database world.
 
You will learn Mike's keys to good storytelling, making analogies, listening, writing, and putting technology concepts into things that give you a common language with business users. You'll leave this session with the ability to influence technology decisions based on your skills explaining why the DBA is usually right.

## Title: Architecting SQL Server for Mission Critical and High Performance
## Description:
### Mission critical SQL Servers require right architecture to satisfy SLAs, high availability, and disaster recovery requirements for your critical IT operational data environment. The ability to scale up these environments, to provide the level of performance required by OLTP and provide adequate resources is a significant operational challenge. The HPE Infrastructure is ideally suited for solving your scalability and performance needs of your OLTP and OLAP workload environments, allowing a single hardware platform to be logically partitioned to support multiple environments and workloads with dynamic allocation of processor, memory, and storage needs of each environment over time. This session will also address performance benefits on virtualizing SQL Server and using Persistent Memory on HPE infrastructure platforms.

## Speaker(s): Bob Ward
## Title: Inside SQL Server In-Memory OLTP
## Description:
### Hekaton is the original project name for In-Memory OLTP and just sounds cooler for a title name. Keeping up the tradition of deep technical “Inside” sessions at PASS, this half-day talk will take you behind the scenes and under the covers on how the In-Memory OLTP functionality works with SQL Server. 

We will cover “everything Hekaton”, including how it is integrated with the SQL Server Engine Architecture. We will explore how data is stored in memory and on disk, how I/O works, how native complied procedures are built and executed. We will also look at how Hekaton integrates with the rest of the engine, including Backup, Restore, Recovery, High-Availability, Transaction Logging, and Troubleshooting. 

Demos are a must for a half-day session like this and what would an inside session be if we didn’t bring out the Windows Debugger. As with previous “Inside…” talks I’ve presented at PASS, this session is level 500 and not for the faint of heart. So read through the docs on In-Memory OLTP and bring some extra pain reliever as we move fast and go deep. 

This session will appear as two sessions in the program guide but is not a Part I and II. It is one complete session with a small break so you should plan to attend it all to get the maximum benefit.

## Speaker(s): Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Extending Applications Securely Using Service Broker
## Description:
### If you’ve ever tried to build a distributed application - one that spans multiple servers or even multiple sites - you know how complex it can be. Web services are a common approach to that problem, but they aren’t the right solution to every problem. SQL Server professionals have another option. Service Broker is designed to run in a distributed architecture, and it has strong built-in security to protect the data as it is being transferred between systems. As an added bonus, Service Broker can also be extended to interact directly with a Windows service, providing a bridge to web services or even Azure. I’ll demonstrate how to implement all of these advanced configurations using concrete, real-world examples in this session.

## Speaker(s): Richard Bolesta
## Title: Safe-Guard Your Career – How to Work Better as a Team and Between Departments
## Description:
### Collaboration and team work are critical to success of any company.”  I’m sure many have heard that statement many times.  It is repeated by management, business writers, authors of organizational books, etc.  Many of the articles and research provided in business press are focused on the success of a company and / or project rather than the impact to one’s career progression.  Your ability to rise through an organization and take on more responsibility, whether you’re in a management or technical track, is greatly affected by team work and collaboration.  Using my experiences and insight as Vice President of Software Engineering, this presentation explores team work and collaboration within a project, between departments and across business units.  It provides insight into behaviors, from managers and individuals, which can build or destroy collaboration, as well as explore how individuals and management can influence collaboration.  More importantly, this presentation brings a view point from senior management of how team work and collaboration can impact careers beyond the obvious.  I welcome interaction from the attendees.

## Title: The Query Store and Query Tuning in SQL Server
## Description:
### For the most part, query tuning in one version of SQL Server is pretty much like query tuning in the next. SQL Server 2016 introduces a number of new functions and methods that directly impact how you’re going to do query tuning in the future. The most important change is the introduction of the Query Store. 

This session will explore how the Query Store works and how it’s going to change the methods you use to tune and troubleshoot query performance. With the information in this session, not only will you understand how the Query Store works, but you’ll know everything you need in order to put it to work with your own SQL Server 2016 tuning efforts, as well as your Azure SQL Databases.

## Title: Combining SQL Server 2016 and Hadoop with Polybase
## Description:
### Data is being stored now not only in relational databases but in Data Lakes and other Hadoop storage methods. Oftentimes, users want to see data from both SQL Server and data stored in Hadoop, which previously was problematic. SQL Server 2016’s Polybase feature provides the ability to look at data stored in Hadoop combined with relational data, all within SQL Server by using Polybase.  Integrating SQL Server data with Hadoop is now possible with no data migration required, all within SSMS. This feature provides the ability to analyze data from multiple sources while using tools SQL Server data professionals know rather than having to apply other languages and tools.

The demos in this session include a review of SQL Server Polybase settings, query formats for accessing Polybase data, and examples of query performance for different types of queries. Attendees will find out limitations of Polybase queries, performance information, and what kind of data works best for SQL and Hadoop.

## Title: Virtual SQL Servers. Actual Performance.
## Description:
### Virtualizing your business-critical SQL Servers should not imply that they will run slower than if they were physical. When properly architected and managed, virtual SQL Servers should be equally as fast as their physical counterparts, if not faster. However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 

This session is packed with many tips and tricks gained from years of experience for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance will be discussed and the knowledge gained will help you work with your infrastructure engineers so you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes will be demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.

## Speaker(s): Andrew Kelly
## Title: Query Store – What is it all about?
## Description:
### SQL 2016 brings us many new features but one of the most anticipated is surely the Query Store. The Query Store now allows us to track query plans as they change over time giving us a whole slew of new possibilities when it comes to tuning our queries. Even just the ability to compare a previous plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. This session will give you the insight to get started using this new and wonderful feature set.

## Speaker(s): Vern Rabe
## Title: It’s Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
## Description:
### Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.

## Title: Why People Should Care About Data Science; or The Hearts and Minds of Data Science
## Description:
### Extraordinary advances in our ability to acquire and generate data are transforming the fundamental nature of discovery across domains. Much of the research in data science has focused on automated methods of analyzing data such as machine learning and new database techniques. Less attention has been directed to the human aspects of data science, including how to build interactive tools that maximize creativity and human insight, and the ethics and societal factors involved in the next generation of data science discoveries. In this talk, I will argue for the importance of a human centered approach to data science as necessary for the success of 21st century discovery. Further, I attest that we need to go beyond well-designed user interfaces for data science software tools to consider the entire ecosystem of software development and use: we need to study people interacting with technology as socio-technical systems, where both technical and social approaches are interwoven. I will discuss promising research in this area, introduce the new Master's Degree in Data Science at the University of Washington, and speculate upon future directions for data science.

## Title: In-Memory OLTP for Developers: What You Need to Know
## Description:
### With the significant improvements made to in-memory OLTP in SQL Server 2016, it’s natural to expect significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  

In this session, we are going to take a look at in-memory tables, their best use cases as well as development best practices. We will also look at the changes to the indexing design for inMemory-based objects and how it differs from existing disk-based table indexing. Finally, we are going to cover how to build fast, scalable applications which utilize inMemory objects, as well as choosing the appropriate indexes for your inMemory objects to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

Event Date: 27-10-2016 10:15 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker(s): Guy Glantser
## Title: Introduction to Azure Machine Learning
## Description:
### Machine Learning is currently one of the hottest buzzwords in the high-tech industry. It’s the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. The idea behind it is to train the system by learning from historical data, and produce a program that can predict future behavior. You probably use Machine Learning dozens of times a day without even knowing about it, like when you search the web, buy something in Amazon, or even when you go through your feed in Facebook.

Azure offers a fully managed Machine Learning cloud service that enables you to easily build, deploy, and share predictive analytics solutions. In this session we will learn what machine learning is and why we should use it, how it can be used to analyze historical data and predict future behavior, what some of the business use cases for machine learning are, and how it all works in Azure. The session includes some examples that will demonstrate the power of Machine Learning.

## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Recovery Models Made SIMPLE
## Description:
### SQL Server always logs every change to a database. But exactly what is logged can vary based on a number of factors. Some operations are referred to as "minimally logged," but even those operations can log a different level of detail depending on your recovery model. This session looks inside the transaction log to see exactly what is logged for minimally logged operations. First, we look at some background information regarding how the log is used and managed, and then we introduce a tool that can help you actually see your log records. When you can query the log, you can determine how logging for operations such as index rebuilds and SELECT INTO differs depending on whether you are using the FULL or BULK_LOGGED recovery model. We also look at other factors in our SQL Server operations that can affect what is actually written to the log. In addition, I’ll describe the benefits and caveats for each of the recovery models.

## Speaker(s): Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: My Favorite Pie (Chart): Simple Rules for Clear Visualizations
## Description:
### Dataviz guru Stephen Few once stated that we should “save the pies for dessert”. What he meant is that pie charts are good in some specific-use cases, but they should not be used in others. The same is true for other chart types. Using the wrong type of chart will make it harder for report users to understand the story behind the data. To enable insights, information has to be presented in the most intuitive way possible. 

You will leave this session with five easy-to-implement rules, which will guide you through the process of creating clear and attractive visualizations. Every rule will be applied through live demos in Excel, Reporting Services, and Power BI Desktop, where you will learn how to avoid pitfalls from the defaults in those tools.

## Speaker(s): Thomas LeBlanc, Bill Anton
## Title: Troubleshooting Analysis Services Performance Issues
## Description:
### Analysis Services performance problems can arise for a variety of reasons: poorly designed data model, lack (or improper use) of partitioning and aggregations, poorly written DAX/MDX calculations, etc. Unfortunately, many people have no idea where to start the troubleshooting process.
 
In this mini-workshop you'll learn how to identify the most common bottlenecks and performance issues and walk away with practical techniques (and scripts!) you can take home and start using immediately. 
 
Your journey will start with learning how to think like the SSAS engine by seeing how a query is broken down into chunks and processed by the various subsystems. Along the way, you'll learn how to use (and automate) the collection of performance counters and extended events. By the end of the session, you'll not only know how to identify performance bottlenecks, but also how to narrow down the list of potential solutions. 
 
Stop guessing what's causing your Analysis Services performance problems!

# Faster Provisioning with SQL Clone

Event Date: 27-10-2016 15:15 - Category: Partner Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application 
## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: Faster Provisioning with SQL Clone
## Description:
### Database provisioning requests are the bane of many DBA’s working lives. Developers want to work with realistic data, DBAs want to protect Production and secure data.
 
But copying databases for development and test is a job that gets 'delegated up'; DBAs, IT Managers, those with the keys to Production find themselves performing the task, and the development team is often blocked while it takes place.
 
The same people are often responsible for ensuring the copy is appropriate for the environment (permissions, configuration data, sensitive data), so have to perform semi-manual tasks and maintain brittle scripts to do so.
 
In this session Redgate’s Grant Fritchey shows how new tool SQL Clone enables self-service or easy automation of database copies and is near-instant at the time of need, using a fraction of the disk space, and allowing quick reversion to a baseline or snapshotting of changes.

## Speaker(s): Andy Galbraith
## Title: Does it Hurt When I Do This? Performing a SQL Server Health Check
## Description:
### How often do you review your SQL Servers for basic security, maintenance, and performance issues? Many of the servers I "inherit" as a managed services provider have quite a few gaping holes. It is not unusual to find databases that are never backed up, servers with constant login failures (is it an attack or a bad connection string?), and servers that need more RAM/CPU/etc. (or sometimes that even have too much!). 

Come learn how to use freely available tools from multiple layers of the SQL Server stack to check your servers for basic issues like missing backups and CheckDB, as well as for more advanced issues like page life expectancy problems and improper indexing. If you are responsible in any way for a Microsoft SQL Server (DBA, Windows Admin, even a Developer) you will see value in this session!

## Title: Migrate to Modern SQL Server Platform from Oracle , MYSQL , SQL using SSMA, DMA and DEA
## Description:
### Come learn about the new enhancements to SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) 7.0 to migrate enterprise features natively to SQL Server and SQL Database. Enhancements to SSMA 7.0 allow directly migration, Column Store Indexes, Temporal Tables, Row Level Security and other features. This session will be demo heavy and illustrate migrations to SQL Server 2016 and SQL Database.  You will also learn how to minimize potential risks while upgrading from older SQL Server versions to the latest SQL Server platform through Data Migration Assistant (DMA). DMA enables users of prior versions to run a set of upgrade rules against their SQL Server database to find breaking and behavior changes between that version and SQL Server 2016, as well as deprecated features that are currently in use. The DMA will also help perform one-click migration to the target platform.  With Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA), you will be able to use key performance insights, captured using a real world workload to help build confidence about upgrade among database administrators, IT management and application owners by minimizing upgrade risks.

## Speaker(s): Hamish Watson
## Title: Overcoming a Culture of FearOps by Adopting DevOps
## Description:
### FearOps is the fear of change; the fear of manual or automated deploys to production systems. DevOps is about aligning Operational and Development teams, utilizing agile methodologies and continuous delivery to optimize database and application rollouts.  

During this session we will demonstrate how DevOps allows you to respond faster to competitive pressures by replacing error-prone (human) processes with automation for improved traceability, reliable, and repeatable deployments.  

DevOps methodologies allow you to develop and use automation techniques for fast, efficient, and reliable software delivery. DevOps is about a cultural shift as much as a process and technological one. This session will illustrate how when you overcome the technical challenges of implementing DevOps you expose the cultural benefits.  

With improved traceability, reliable, and repeatable deployments, this session will help you remove FearOps from your organisation.

## Title: Deep Dive into the SSIS Catalog
## Description:
### The SSIS catalog is one of the best-evolved features in the SQL Server Integration Services ecosystem. With integrated package storage, Windows ACL-like security settings, built-in logging, and many other features, the SSIS catalog has become an anchor for many ETL architectures. With all this complexity, it is important to understand the inner workings of the SSIS catalog to keep it running smoothly.

In this demo-heavy presentation, we will dive into the details of the SSIS catalog. We will start with a quick survey of catalog features, followed by an exploration of the moving parts (tables, views, and stored procedures) in the catalog database. We will also review the security capabilities in the catalog, and will discuss maintenance operations. Finally, we'll walk through the mechanics of deployment and execution, reviewing what happens under the covers during these operations.

## Title: Using Azure Machine Learning to Predict Consumer Price Index
## Description:
### Inflation is one of the economic phenomena that receive particular attention from public policy actors, because of its effects on the allocation of resources, the distribution of income, economic development, and on the wellbeing of societies. Therefore, having an early and reliable vision of inflation enables defining appropriate anti-inflationary policies to achieve stability in the purchasing power of currencies.

Through leveraging Azure+PowerBI resources for data scraping, analytics, and visualization, it is possible to obtain:
* access to continuously updated CPI forecasts
* various CPI breakdown (by segment, industry, etc.)
* costs reduction, compared to traditional processes for capturing and processing
* increased focus on internal analysts’ teams in analytical work itself
* increased quality and relevance of the information, which allows decision makers to have greater confidence in the indicators and predictions when making decisions.

## Title: Biml Recipes: Automatically Create T-SQL Scripts for Common Tasks
## Description:
### You've probably heard a lot about Biml for SSIS automation, but did you know it can also be used for building complex, yet reusable T-SQL statements for common database tasks? And, in most cases, much faster and more easily than you could with dynamic T-SQL.

This will be a scenario-driven session where we discuss many real-world examples of manual tasks that can be automated with Biml snippets and the free BIDS Helper AddIn to BIDS/SSDT. You will receive all code for your own use.

Scenarios include:
1. Generation of T-SQL merge statements that removes all the drudgery of manually mapping columns - including complex SCD column handling.
2. Stale data detection that uses Biml to create queries that display ranges for all date/time columns in each table of a target database - perfect for retiring tables from WorkDB and other ad hoc environments.
3. Sample data creation that automatically produces test data based on DDL schema information from your data model.
4. And much more.

## Speaker(s): Guy Glantser
## Title: From XML to JSON
## Description:
### XML and JSON are two widely used markup languages, shared by many applications and data platforms. Since SQL Server 2005, there is native support for XML, which means we can extract relational data from XML documents as well as generate XML documents from relational data. We can also use namespaces, schemas, and indexes in order to apply constraints on the contents of XML documents, as well as to speed up query performance. SQL Server 2016 provides support for JSON, so that we can do more or less the same things with JSON.

In this session we will learn how to work efficiently with these two markup languages in SQL Server. We will discuss use cases for using either XML or JSON. We will compare a few methods and talk about the performance impact of each. If you’re a developer and you need to manipulate XML or JSON files in SQL Server, then this session is for you.

## Description:
### The most mundane task of the DBA that we all thought we could do with our eyes closed has become complicated again. There is no single, simple backup/restore (or import/export) story for on-premises databases, databases in SQL Server on an Azure VM and Azure SQL Databases.

In this session we will look at the various ways to archive and move databases around within the Azure (hybrid) cloud. Learn how to move data between SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, move data between your datacenter and Azure, create backups for long term storage to comply with your corporate data retention policy, and create (automated) database copies for your developers.

We will discuss the various options and their respective pros and cons. 

This session will restore (pun intended) your confidence in your backup/restore skills.

## Title: Data Storytelling Using Power BI
## Description:
### In today's world, data is omnipresent and most organizations are presented with billions of data points every morning. Good analysis parses these numerical outputs into an understanding of the organization or process. In short, it “humanizes” the data by turning raw numbers into a story about the performance. The challenge is to interpret these stories correctly and for that, we need the help of data visualization tools like Microsoft Power BI. 

Join me as I take you through on how to utilize Power BI effectively to tell data stories and engage your audience. Watch and learn some of the top techniques and hacks on making aesthetic as well as relevant Power BI reports for effective storytelling.

## Speaker(s): Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Building Secure Applications in Azure SQL Database
## Description:
### Cloud computing requires new security paradigms that are unfamiliar to many application users, database administrators, and programmers. Consequently, some organizations are hesitant to implement a cloud infrastructure for data management due to perceived security risks. However, much of this concern can be alleviated through a better understanding of the security features built into Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

Azure provides extremely robust security protection at the physical, logical, and data layers of its services and applications, making Azure datacenters among the most secure facilities of their kind in the world. Likewise, Azure SQL Database includes multiple layers of security, with role-based logical data protection and auditing to monitor the security of your data.

## Title: How to Get Fired as a DBA
## Description:
### As senior data professionals, we get to see first-hand the ways that team members choose to attack problems and live with the challenges of too little time and too much to do. It's understandable that short cuts have to be made, that some tricks work because no one ever gets caught or because we are asked to fight fires all day.  

In this session, we will share with you the types of behaviors we've seen in real life that will likely get you fired if you try them. Then for each, we'll discuss how to recover from them. We'll also give you some real-world stories of how some people made their situation even worse. It won't be all serious; we have some great #FAIL stories of our own and we managed to survive.

## Title: Mitigating a SQL Server Upgrade Disaster
## Description:
### SQL Server 2016 easily represents Microsoft's biggest release ever. But with so many changes in the database engine upgrading to the latest version of SQL Server represents a larger risk as well. Many customers have upgraded to the latest version "unaware" and been caught out with degraded performance and expectations not being realised. This session will discuss the important database engine changes that will potentially directly impact your upgrade path and outcome. It will highlight the key risks, how to detect them and what mitigation techniques can be used. It will set realistic expectations to all stakeholders of what the upgrade will deliver. Finally it will present a methodology that can be used to ensure a successful upgrade project that delivers optimal performance and reliability. With plenty of real-world case studies this should prove to be a very informative and practical session.

## Speaker(s): Tara Shankar Jana
## Title: Build Smarter and Scalable Applications Using Azure Database Services
## Description:
### In this real-life customer scenario of “GeoSafe”, learn how to build a “persistent” data pattern, and intelligence that is critical to modern cloud hosted applications. Requirements of modern applications, such as, greater scale, availability, actionable insights, forecasting, predictions and security have driven the industry to begin using a much broader range of technologies for storing data within an application. Microsoft Azure provides a range of storage technologies that support these architectures, and this demo-heavy session; provides a real-life example of the use of these azure data services in the well understood SaaS application scenario. With Microsoft Azure database services, you can quickly design, deploy, and manage highly-available apps that scale without downtime and are highly secure.

# Algorithms For Searching Through Encrypted Data

## Speaker(s): Mladen Prajdić
## Title: Algorithms For Searching Through Encrypted Data
## Description:
### Proper way of storing encrypted data is to encrypt it on the client and send it to the server that doesn't know how to decrypt it. However, this solution lacks a simple way of searching through the encrypted data once it's on the server. You can do equality checks, but that's where most applications stop. But what to do if you have thousands of text documents you need to search through? Getting them all to the client and decrypting them there is simply out of the question as it would slow the system down to a crawl due to latency.

In this session we'll take a look at a few algorithms that enable you to search through the encrypted text data on the server without decrypting anything and returning only the search results to the client with performance in mind.
Just the way a search should be performed.

## Title: When Database Corruption Strikes
## Description:
### You database is running fine month after month with no problems. Suddenly someone reports that their query won’t run. They get an error stating “SQL Server detected a logical consistency-based I/O error", or something even scarier. Do you know what to do now? 

We will walk through three corrupt databases exploring ways to go about finding and fixing the corruption. More importantly we will explore how to prevent further data loss at the time corruption occurs. Learn what things you can do to protect yourself when corruption strikes. Learn how to avoid making things worse, and how to protect your data if things do get worse. You will leave with a checklist of steps to use when you encounter corruption. By the end of this session you will be ready to take on corruption, one database at a time.

# Agile Development Fundamentals: Continuous Integration with SSDT
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 28-10-2016 15:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application 
## Speaker(s): Jon Boulineau
## Title: Agile Development Fundamentals: Continuous Integration with SSDT
## Description:
### For agile development teams, Continuous Integration is a must-have. Until recently, implementing this lean standard for database development has been a frustrating exercise due to lack of tooling. Improvements to SQL Server Data Tools by Microsoft have delivered teams a powerful framework for developing databases. With Continuous Integration, development teams depend on automated unit testing to drive the design of databases while enforcing strong disciplines. Best of all, incrementally building robust suites of unit tests allows teams to maintain a high level of confidence in their code that survives the rapid rate of change demanded by agile software projects. 

This demo-heavy session walks through the beginning-to-end processes of implementing Continuous Integration and inspires developers to become passionate practitioners of agile practices.

## Title: All About SQL Injection
## Description:
### SQL injection has consistently ranked as one of the top security threats in software development. Businesses have experienced massive data breaches and have even been forced to close as a result of security holes related to SQL injection.

Proactive solutions are key to preventing SQL injection and ensuring that hackers don't see your application as an easy target. We will demonstrate common mistakes that lead to SQL injection and a variety of ways which can safeguard our data against attacks.

While illustrating the ways in which hackers probe and attack our systems, we will show that SQL injection is not only the result of bad TSQL, but also bad code. By securing our data from the application and database tiers, we can greatly decrease their attractiveness to hackers and prevent attacks that could cripple a business permanently.
