## Speaker(s): Brian Larson
## Title: Effective Data Visualization with SQL 2016 - Data Near and Far
## Description:
### This day-long session will explore the data visualization tools available through SQL Server 2016. Particular emphasis will be placed on best practices for providing quick, accurate understanding and easy exploration of the information presented. 

The session will include tips and tricks for creating simple, easily maintainable visualizations of complex datasets. Along the way, we will look at innovative ways to utilize features such as scope, dynamic report properties, images, and SQL Server spatial data types to push our visualizations to the limits. 

As we examine each data visualization tool, we will discuss its strengths, weaknesses, and ways in which it can best be utilized. The session will also cover methods for secure, efficient delivery of visualizations both inside and outside of the organization. We may even play a SQL Server visualization-based game or two!

# Dr. DMV: How to Use DMVs to Diagnose Performance Problems
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 24-10-2016 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Glenn Berry
## Title: Dr. DMV: How to Use DMVs to Diagnose Performance Problems
## Description:
### SQL Server 2005 introduced Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) that allow you to see exactly what is happening inside your SQL Server instances and databases with much more detail than ever before. SQL Server 2016 adds even more capability in this area. You can discover your top wait types, most CPU intensive stored procedures, find missing indexes, and identify unused indexes, to name just a few examples. This session (which is applicable to SQL 2005-2016), presents and explains over seventy DMV queries that you can quickly and easily use to detect and diagnose performance issues in your environment. 

If you have ever been responsible for a mission critical database, you have probably been faced with a high stress, emergency situation where a database issue is causing unacceptable application performance, resulting in angry users and hovering managers and executives. If this hasn't happened to you yet, thank your lucky stars, but start getting prepared for your time in the hot seat. This session will show you how to use DMV queries to quickly detect and diagnose the problem, starting at the server and instance level, and then progressing down to the database and object level. 

This session will show you how to properly analyze and interpret the results of every single query in the set, along with lots of information on how to properly configure your instance and databases.

# High Performance T-SQL for the Experienced Database Practitioner
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 24-10-2016 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Application 
## Speaker(s): Itzik Ben-Gan
## Title: High Performance T-SQL for the Experienced Database Practitioner
## Description:
### You’re a database practitioner with several years of experience writing lots of T-SQL code, but most of what you know you learned on the job. You’re thinking that perhaps you’re not using all that the language has to offer, and that your solutions to T-SQL querying and programming tasks might not be the most optimal. If you’re nodding while reading this, this full-day seminar is for you!

The seminar covers the APPLY operator, its optimization considerations and practical use cases. For example, you will learn about querying tasks where you need to control whether the optimizer will use a seek-based or a scan-based strategy depending on the density of the data, and how APPLY can help you to address this need. 

The seminar covers window functions, their optimization considerations and practical uses. You will learn about aggregate, ranking and offset window functions, and how such functions introduce a whole new way of solving T-SQL problems in general. 

You will learn about pivoting and unpivoting techniques, including specialized cases and dynamic pivoting. You will also learn about the OFFSET-FETCH filter and how to tune queries using it.

The seminar also covers SQL Server 2016 additions related to temporal data including system-versioned temporal tables and the AT TIME ZONE function.
If time permits, the seminar will cover additional T-SQL querying and programming topics such as dynamic search conditions, sequences and how access methods are affected by isolation levels.

# AlmostOn: Troubleshooting Clustered Implementations of SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 24-10-2016 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: AlmostOn: Troubleshooting Clustered Implementations of SQL Server
## Description:
### Server down situations are stressful for everyone. Every second counts as you struggle to get things get things running again. Highly available SQL Server architectures are often complex; they can experience and sometimes even cause outages – especially if they are not implemented properly. Troubleshooting clustered instances (FCIs) and availability groups (AGs) is a skill anyone who deploys these features should have. However, this is a difficult skill set to acquire since downtime in the real world administers the test first and the education afterwards. 

In addition, FCIs and AGs are tightly coupled solutions utilizing a Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC), networking, Active Directory, DNS, and more. Without understanding these things, troubleshooting becomes nearly impossible. 

This full-day pre-con will teach you approaches for dealing with real-world problems related to the different clustered configurations of SQL Server whether they are FCIs or AGs. You’ll learn about the tools and utilities you can use for diagnosis, common failure scenarios, and solutions, avoiding problems by being proactive, and more. Each student will also gain hands on experience via one or more lab scenarios using their own laptop connected to Web-based virtual machines where learning translates into action to bring a broken HA environment online.

# SQL Server Index Formulas: Problems and Solutions
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 25-10-2016 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Application 
## Speaker(s): Kendra Little
## Title: SQL Server Index Formulas: Problems and Solutions
## Description:
### Every SQL Server developer must know the essentials of clustered and non-clustered index design to build fast and reliable applications. You need scripts to show when a new non-clustered index, filtered index, or indexed view will improve performance on a live SQL Server workload, and the skills to design the best index. 

In this example-packed full-day session, you will work through a series of problems and solutions to learn how to create and tune indexes. You will learn how to select and order key columns, when included columns help, when to use special indexes, and when to drop indexes. You will see how SQL Server 2016’s new Query Store feature offers you new tools for improving your indexes, and how Query Store compares to index dynamic management views. 

You'll leave with all the scripts for the problems and solutions covered in the course, plus a set of additional exercises to keep building your index skills.

## Speaker(s): David Klee
## Title: The Complete Primer to SQL Server Virtualization
## Description:
### Your SQL Servers are probably virtualized at this point, but do you feel you have lost that control over the infrastructure that you used to have when they were physical servers? Do the virtual SQL Servers “feel” slower after they were virtualized? When architected and managed with SQL Server in mind, this added layer will help improve the SQL Server’s availability and ability to change with the business, but only when executed properly.

This all-day interactive and hypervisor-agnostic session is designed to help data professionals learn more about virtualization and infrastructure, and discover how this new layer can be used to improve the management, availability, and performance of their databases. You will be exposed to all layers of virtualization underneath the SQL Server, from the storage to the hypervisor, and will discover many useful tips and tricks to tuning the database layer to boost performance and availability. The following topics will be addressed during the session:
•	virtualization and infrastructure fundamentals
•	the SQL Server Virtual Machine
•	networking, support, and licensing
•	High Availability and Disaster Recovery
•	performance investigation and tuning of the entire stack.

# Locking, Blocking, Versions: Concurrency for Maximum Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 25-10-2016 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Locking, Blocking, Versions: Concurrency for Maximum Performance
## Description:
### Failing to design an application with concurrency in mind, and failure to test an application with the maximum number of expected simultaneous users is one of the main causes of poor application performance. 

SQL Server offers two methods for an application to provide data consistency: Pessimistic and Optimistic Concurrency Control. In this seminar we’ll discuss what consistency might mean to your applications, and describe the details of how each of the concurrency models works internally. We’ll examine the costs and trade-offs between the two concurrency models that SQL Server 2014 supports through different transaction isolation levels. Finally, we’ll examine the tools available for analyzing and troubleshooting blocking problems, including metadata views and Extended Events. You will learn:

•	why concurrency management is a crucial part of database and application tuning
•	how each of the transaction isolation levels impacts concurrency
•	the details of how SQL Server implements pessimistic concurrency through locking, and when locking causes blocking
•	how the snapshot-based isolation levels implement optimistic concurrency, and the problems to be aware of 
•	how In-Memory OLTP allows maximum concurrency with no locking
•	how to use the metadata views and Extended Events to troubleshoot concurrency problems and monitor the resources used to manage concurrency.

# Enabling Business-Driven Self-Service BI within Enterprise IT
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 26-10-2016 10:15 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker(s): Dean Furness
## Title: Enabling Business-Driven Self-Service BI within Enterprise IT
## Description:
### Bringing the promise of BI to a large organization can be a challenge, especially with the presence of tried and true project delivery processes where it can take months to move a project from idea to funding and release. While there is a need for the IT organization to be involved and engaged when developing BI, the business is often moving much faster than IT can react. As such, the IT-delivered solution comes too late, was created with expired requirements, and has already been replaced with a LOB-created solution. 

This session will present an approach that brings the LOB and IT together in a partnership that embraces self-service BI while maintaining a level of rigor and oversight – combining typical project processes with a task-driven agile approach. As a result, BI solutions can be brought to market quicker, supporting the LOB and keeping IT relevant.

# Inside SQL Server In-Memory OLTP
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 26-10-2016 13:30 - Category: Half-Day MS CSS Session (3 hours) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Bob Ward
## Title: Inside SQL Server In-Memory OLTP
## Description:
### Hekaton is the original project name for In-Memory OLTP and just sounds cooler for a title name. Keeping up the tradition of deep technical “Inside” sessions at PASS, this half-day talk will take you behind the scenes and under the covers on how the In-Memory OLTP functionality works with SQL Server. 

We will cover “everything Hekaton”, including how it is integrated with the SQL Server Engine Architecture. We will explore how data is stored in memory and on disk, how I/O works, how native complied procedures are built and executed. We will also look at how Hekaton integrates with the rest of the engine, including Backup, Restore, Recovery, High-Availability, Transaction Logging, and Troubleshooting. 

Demos are a must for a half-day session like this and what would an inside session be if we didn’t bring out the Windows Debugger. As with previous “Inside…” talks I’ve presented at PASS, this session is level 500 and not for the faint of heart. So read through the docs on In-Memory OLTP and bring some extra pain reliever as we move fast and go deep. 

This session will appear as two sessions in the program guide but is not a Part I and II. It is one complete session with a small break so you should plan to attend it all to get the maximum benefit.

# Extending Applications Securely Using Service Broker
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 26-10-2016 13:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application 
## Speaker(s): Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Extending Applications Securely Using Service Broker
## Description:
### If you’ve ever tried to build a distributed application - one that spans multiple servers or even multiple sites - you know how complex it can be. Web services are a common approach to that problem, but they aren’t the right solution to every problem. SQL Server professionals have another option. Service Broker is designed to run in a distributed architecture, and it has strong built-in security to protect the data as it is being transferred between systems. As an added bonus, Service Broker can also be extended to interact directly with a Windows service, providing a bridge to web services or even Azure. I’ll demonstrate how to implement all of these advanced configurations using concrete, real-world examples in this session.

## Speaker(s): Richard Bolesta
## Title: Safe-Guard Your Career – How to Work Better as a Team and Between Departments
## Description:
### Collaboration and team work are critical to success of any company.”  I’m sure many have heard that statement many times.  It is repeated by management, business writers, authors of organizational books, etc.  Many of the articles and research provided in business press are focused on the success of a company and / or project rather than the impact to one’s career progression.  Your ability to rise through an organization and take on more responsibility, whether you’re in a management or technical track, is greatly affected by team work and collaboration.  Using my experiences and insight as Vice President of Software Engineering, this presentation explores team work and collaboration within a project, between departments and across business units.  It provides insight into behaviors, from managers and individuals, which can build or destroy collaboration, as well as explore how individuals and management can influence collaboration.  More importantly, this presentation brings a view point from senior management of how team work and collaboration can impact careers beyond the obvious.  I welcome interaction from the attendees.

## Speaker(s): Tim Mitchell, Stuart Ainsworth
## Title: Making the Business Case for Training
## Description:
### Employers desire skilled employees, but training expenses are typically one of the first line items to be scrutinized (and cut) during budget planning meetings.  While free training has become increasingly available through events such as SQL Saturdays and the 24HOP, it doesn't offset the need for in-depth face-to-face educational opportunities.  As an employee, how do you build the case to your boss to justify training expenses?
 
This session will attempt to answer that question by providing you with a framework to build a persuasive argument. The presenters will provide insights from their combined 37 years of experience as employees, managers, educators, and community leaders.  We'll cover how to determine your boss's receptiveness to training, discover currently available resources for education, and building a persuasive argument based on business objectives. We will also review the differences in quality of training resources, both free and paid, to help those controlling the purse strings understand why training is a solid investment.

However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 

This session is packed with many tips and tricks gained from years of experience for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance will be discussed and the knowledge gained will help you work with your infrastructure engineers so you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes will be demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.

Event Date: 26-10-2016 16:45 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application 
## Speaker(s): Kevin Kline
## Title: Four Ways We Kill the SQL Server Plan Cache
## Description:
### SQL Server’s plan cache is one of the largest regions of memory and is used to store all SQL queries and T-SQL code for quick execution. It is largely self-maintaining and self-tuning. However, the kind of queries you write and the way you invoke those queries can have an enormous impact on how the plan cache is maintained, tuned, and optimized. If you don’t do things right, you could end up shooting yourself in the foot and making performance much worse. Attend this demo-loaded session to learn about 4 harmful anti-patterns that developers frequently use without knowing their drawbacks.  

This session will answer questions like:
-	What’s currently in the plan cache?
-	How often is the code in my plan cache being reused?
-	Where are the big opportunities to save space in the plan cache?
-	What coding techniques are most likely to make my object recompile unnecessarily or cause SQL Server to cache inefficient query plans?

## Speaker(s): Jakub Szymaszek, Rebecca Zhang
## Title: Protecting Sensitive Data with Always Encrypted
## Description:
### Data security is a primary concern of customers considering moving their applications to the cloud. While encryption at-rest is the first line of defense against data theft, customers frequently expect stronger security guarantees.Always Encrypted in Azure SQL Database ensures sensitive data is protected not only at-rest, but also in use. In fact, the data never appears in plaintext in Azure SQL Database, as it is transparently encrypted inside an application. Consequently, even DBAs and Microsoft Azure administrators cannot access sensitive data. In this demo-heavy session, we will showcase the value of Always Encrypted using customer scenarios and case studies. We will also update the audience on the latest tools and enhancements for Always Encrypted.

## Speaker(s): Andrew Kelly
## Title: Query Store – What is it all about?
## Description:
### SQL 2016 brings us many new features but one of the most anticipated is surely the Query Store. The Query Store now allows us to track query plans as they change over time giving us a whole slew of new possibilities when it comes to tuning our queries. Even just the ability to compare a previous plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. This session will give you the insight to get started using this new and wonderful feature set.

# It’s Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 27-10-2016 10:15 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Vern Rabe
## Title: It’s Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016
## Description:
### Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.

## Speaker(s): Cecilia Aragon
## Title: Why People Should Care About Data Science; or The Hearts and Minds of Data Science
## Description:
### Extraordinary advances in our ability to acquire and generate data are transforming the fundamental nature of discovery across domains. Much of the research in data science has focused on automated methods of analyzing data such as machine learning and new database techniques. Less attention has been directed to the human aspects of data science, including how to build interactive tools that maximize creativity and human insight, and the ethics and societal factors involved in the next generation of data science discoveries. In this talk, I will argue for the importance of a human centered approach to data science as necessary for the success of 21st century discovery. Further, I attest that we need to go beyond well-designed user interfaces for data science software tools to consider the entire ecosystem of software development and use: we need to study people interacting with technology as socio-technical systems, where both technical and social approaches are interwoven. I will discuss promising research in this area, introduce the new Master's Degree in Data Science at the University of Washington, and speculate upon future directions for data science.

### “Governed Self-Service Analytics on Big Data” is nothing more than a pipe dream for most enterprises.  Whether you’re an Analysis Services expert or a PowerBI ninja, your team is bound to run into major limitations when they connect BI tools to a Big Data Source (Hadoop, HDI, Teradata...etc).
In this session full of demos, former Microsoft BI executive, Bruno Aziza (now at AtScale), takes you through the Do’s and Don’ts of BI on Big Data.  

We will cover:
•	Why moving data is evil when all you’re trying to do is provide employees with live, fast and unencumbered access to relevant data.
•	Why SQL, DAX and MDX don’t matter in the end.  All you need is the right semantic layer practices to rule them all
•	How you can make ANY BI tool (not just PowerBI and Excel) perform on all Big Data sources?
•	Why your SQL Analysis expertise can be leveraged TODAY for all data - Small and Big, Hadoop and Non-Hadoop.

WARNING: This session is not for the shy and faint-hearted.  We want you to bring your questions.  We want you to be ready to take some of ours (brave participants will be rewarded with awesome gifts).

## Speaker(s): Paul Ou Yang
## Title: Untangling the Spaghetti Graph
## Description:
### You chose a line graph in SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to visualize your data but it shows a bunch of tangled lines like spaghetti and you wonder how to untangle them to convey the information you want. In this session, using a real case scenario of a spaghetti graph, we step through its different alternatives, such as using color to emphasize a single line at a time, using spark lines to break it down into multiple smaller graphs, and using data bars to complement the information. In addition, you will learn practical tips in SSRS that can enhance the visual sense of your graphs and communicate the information efficiently.

## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Recovery Models Made SIMPLE
## Description:
### SQL Server always logs every change to a database. But exactly what is logged can vary based on a number of factors. Some operations are referred to as "minimally logged," but even those operations can log a different level of detail depending on your recovery model. This session looks inside the transaction log to see exactly what is logged for minimally logged operations. First, we look at some background information regarding how the log is used and managed, and then we introduce a tool that can help you actually see your log records. When you can query the log, you can determine how logging for operations such as index rebuilds and SELECT INTO differs depending on whether you are using the FULL or BULK_LOGGED recovery model. We also look at other factors in our SQL Server operations that can affect what is actually written to the log. In addition, I’ll describe the benefits and caveats for each of the recovery models.

## Speaker(s): Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: My Favorite Pie (Chart): Simple Rules for Clear Visualizations
## Description:
### Dataviz guru Stephen Few once stated that we should “save the pies for dessert”. What he meant is that pie charts are good in some specific-use cases, but they should not be used in others. The same is true for other chart types. Using the wrong type of chart will make it harder for report users to understand the story behind the data. To enable insights, information has to be presented in the most intuitive way possible. 

You will leave this session with five easy-to-implement rules, which will guide you through the process of creating clear and attractive visualizations. Every rule will be applied through live demos in Excel, Reporting Services, and Power BI Desktop, where you will learn how to avoid pitfalls from the defaults in those tools.

In this mini-workshop you'll learn how to identify the most common bottlenecks and performance issues and walk away with practical techniques (and scripts!) you can take home and start using immediately. 
 
Your journey will start with learning how to think like the SSAS engine by seeing how a query is broken down into chunks and processed by the various subsystems. Along the way, you'll learn how to use (and automate) the collection of performance counters and extended events. By the end of the session, you'll not only know how to identify performance bottlenecks, but also how to narrow down the list of potential solutions. 
 
Stop guessing what's causing your Analysis Services performance problems!

Event Date: 27-10-2016 15:15 - Category: Partner Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application 
## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: Faster Provisioning with SQL Clone
## Description:
### Database provisioning requests are the bane of many DBA’s working lives. Developers want to work with realistic data, DBAs want to protect Production and secure data.
 
But copying databases for development and test is a job that gets 'delegated up'; DBAs, IT Managers, those with the keys to Production find themselves performing the task, and the development team is often blocked while it takes place.
 
The same people are often responsible for ensuring the copy is appropriate for the environment (permissions, configuration data, sensitive data), so have to perform semi-manual tasks and maintain brittle scripts to do so.
 
In this session Redgate’s Grant Fritchey shows how new tool SQL Clone enables self-service or easy automation of database copies and is near-instant at the time of need, using a fraction of the disk space, and allowing quick reversion to a baseline or snapshotting of changes.

#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 28-10-2016 11:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Scott Currie
## Title: Biml Recipes: Automatically Create T-SQL Scripts for Common Tasks
## Description:
### You've probably heard a lot about Biml for SSIS automation, but did you know it can also be used for building complex, yet reusable T-SQL statements for common database tasks? And, in most cases, much faster and more easily than you could with dynamic T-SQL.

This will be a scenario-driven session where we discuss many real-world examples of manual tasks that can be automated with Biml snippets and the free BIDS Helper AddIn to BIDS/SSDT. You will receive all code for your own use.

Scenarios include:
1. Generation of T-SQL merge statements that removes all the drudgery of manually mapping columns - including complex SCD column handling.
2. Stale data detection that uses Biml to create queries that display ranges for all date/time columns in each table of a target database - perfect for retiring tables from WorkDB and other ad hoc environments.
3. Sample data creation that automatically produces test data based on DDL schema information from your data model.
4. And much more.

## Speaker(s): Sean McCown
## Title: Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA
## Description:
### Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds. I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. 

Here you’ll learn:
• the most useful regular expression commands
• the appropriate times to use regular expressions
• how to use regular expressions to write code for you 
• how to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

# From XML to JSON
#### [Back to calendar](#id-583)
Event Date: 28-10-2016 11:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application 
## Speaker(s): Guy Glantser
## Title: From XML to JSON
## Description:
### XML and JSON are two widely used markup languages, shared by many applications and data platforms. Since SQL Server 2005, there is native support for XML, which means we can extract relational data from XML documents as well as generate XML documents from relational data. We can also use namespaces, schemas, and indexes in order to apply constraints on the contents of XML documents, as well as to speed up query performance. SQL Server 2016 provides support for JSON, so that we can do more or less the same things with JSON.

In this session we will learn how to work efficiently with these two markup languages in SQL Server. We will discuss use cases for using either XML or JSON. We will compare a few methods and talk about the performance impact of each. If you’re a developer and you need to manipulate XML or JSON files in SQL Server, then this session is for you.

## Speaker(s): André Kamman
## Title: How to move databases around in Azure
## Description:
### The most mundane task of the DBA that we all thought we could do with our eyes closed has become complicated again. There is no single, simple backup/restore (or import/export) story for on-premises databases, databases in SQL Server on an Azure VM and Azure SQL Databases.

In this session we will look at the various ways to archive and move databases around within the Azure (hybrid) cloud. Learn how to move data between SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, move data between your datacenter and Azure, create backups for long term storage to comply with your corporate data retention policy, and create (automated) database copies for your developers.

We will discuss the various options and their respective pros and cons. 

This session will restore (pun intended) your confidence in your backup/restore skills.

## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Now Where Did THAT Estimate Come From?
## Description:
### "The SQL Server Query Optimizer makes its plan choices based on estimated rowcounts. If those estimates are wrong, the optimizer will very likely produce a poor plan. And there's nothing you can do about it. Or is there?

In this session, you will learn exactly where these estimates come from. You will gain intimate knowledge of how statistics are built and maintained and how they are used to estimate row counts. But you will also learn how filters and joins influence those estimates.

Though the focus of this session is on understanding the cause of bad estimates, you will also learn ways to fix the problems and get better estimates - and hence, better performing queries."

## Speaker(s): Jason Thomas
## Title: Data Storytelling Using Power BI
## Description:
### In today's world, data is omnipresent and most organizations are presented with billions of data points every morning. Good analysis parses these numerical outputs into an understanding of the organization or process. In short, it “humanizes” the data by turning raw numbers into a story about the performance. The challenge is to interpret these stories correctly and for that, we need the help of data visualization tools like Microsoft Power BI. 

Join me as I take you through on how to utilize Power BI effectively to tell data stories and engage your audience. Watch and learn some of the top techniques and hacks on making aesthetic as well as relevant Power BI reports for effective storytelling. Also, watch out for some engaging examples of storytelling using Power BI (which also includes the winning report of the Microsoft Power BI Best Report contest!)

## Speaker(s): Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Building Secure Applications in Azure SQL Database
## Description:
### Cloud computing requires new security paradigms that are unfamiliar to many application users, database administrators, and programmers. Consequently, some organizations are hesitant to implement a cloud infrastructure for data management due to perceived security risks. However, much of this concern can be alleviated through a better understanding of the security features built into Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

Azure provides extremely robust security protection at the physical, logical, and data layers of its services and applications, making Azure datacenters among the most secure facilities of their kind in the world. Likewise, Azure SQL Database includes multiple layers of security, with role-based logical data protection and auditing to monitor the security of your data.

## Speaker(s): Gail Shaw
## Title: Go, Go, QueryStore!
## Description:
### One of the hardest things to do in SQL is to identify the cause of a sudden degradation in performance. The DMVs don’t persist information over a restart of the instance and, unless there was already some query benchmarking (and there almost never is), answering the question of how the queries behaved last week needs a time machine. Up until now, that is. The addition of the QueryStore to SQL Server 2016 makes identifying and resolving performance regressions a breeze.

In this session we’ll take a look at what the QueryStore is and how it works, before diving into a scenario where overall performance suddenly degraded, and we’ll see why QueryStore is the best new feature in SQL Server 2016, bar none.

## Speaker(s): Mladen Prajdić
## Title: Algorithms For Searching Through Encrypted Data
## Description:
### Proper way of storing encrypted data is to encrypt it on the client and send it to the server that doesn't know how to decrypt it. However, this solution lacks a simple way of searching through the encrypted data once it's on the server. You can do equality checks, but that's where most applications stop. But what to do if you have thousands of text documents you need to search through? Getting them all to the client and decrypting them there is simply out of the question as it would slow the system down to a crawl due to latency.

In this session we'll take a look at a few algorithms that enable you to search through the encrypted text data on the server without decrypting anything and returning only the search results to the client with performance in mind.
Just the way a search should be performed.

## Speaker(s): Jon Boulineau
## Title: Agile Development Fundamentals: Continuous Integration with SSDT
## Description:
### For agile development teams, Continuous Integration is a must-have. Until recently, implementing this lean standard for database development has been a frustrating exercise due to lack of tooling. Improvements to SQL Server Data Tools by Microsoft have delivered teams a powerful framework for developing databases. With Continuous Integration, development teams depend on automated unit testing to drive the design of databases while enforcing strong disciplines. Best of all, incrementally building robust suites of unit tests allows teams to maintain a high level of confidence in their code that survives the rapid rate of change demanded by agile software projects. 

This demo-heavy session walks through the beginning-to-end processes of implementing Continuous Integration and inspires developers to become passionate practitioners of agile practices.

## Speaker(s): Edward Pollack
## Title: All About SQL Injection
## Description:
### SQL injection has consistently ranked as one of the top security threats in software development. Businesses have experienced massive data breaches and have even been forced to close as a result of security holes related to SQL injection.

Proactive solutions are key to preventing SQL injection and ensuring that hackers don't see your application as an easy target. We will demonstrate common mistakes that lead to SQL injection and a variety of ways which can safeguard our data against attacks.

While illustrating the ways in which hackers probe and attack our systems, we will show that SQL injection is not only the result of bad TSQL, but also bad code. By securing our data from the application and database tiers, we can greatly decrease their attractiveness to hackers and prevent attacks that could cripple a business permanently.
