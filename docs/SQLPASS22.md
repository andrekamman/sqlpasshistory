# Three Ways to Identify Slow Running Queries
#### [Back to calendar](#id-22)
Event Date: 20-09-2012 00:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: Three Ways to Identify Slow Running Queries
## Description:
### Tuning the performance of your queries in SQL Server can be a lot of work. But, in order for your systems to receive the full benefits of query tuning, you need to tune the queries that need it the most. This session will show you three different methods for determining which of the queries on your system are being called the most frequently, take the longest period of time to run, or are using the most resources. You'll be able to use the information in this session to quickly set up your own metrics gathering processes in order to understand what is happening on your systems and which queries will benefit most from tuning. The information presented is a sub-set of a much larger set of information that will be made available to you during my PASS Summit 2012 pre-conference seminar, Query Performance Tuning: Start.

# SQL Server Private Cloud != Azure
#### [Back to calendar](#id-22)
Event Date: 20-09-2012 00:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Cloud Application Development & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt, Ben DeBow
## Title: SQL Server Private Cloud != Azure
## Description:
### Many of us roll our eyes at the mention of the word “cloud” since it is used so much these days from private computing at home all the way to the largest enterprises. In the SQL Server world, it’s most commonly associated with Microsoft’s Azure – but that’s not the only application for the term cloud when it comes to databases. Like virtualization a few years back, the cloud hasn’t completely permeated the database world just yet, but it will be something all DBAs need to be comfortable with down the road. This session will lay a foundation of what the cloud, and specifically, the private cloud means for SQL Server DBAs. So get a jump start on tomorrow by attending this today.

# PowerShell 101 for the SQL Server DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#id-22)
Event Date: 20-09-2012 00:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Allen White
## Title: PowerShell 101 for the SQL Server DBA
## Description:
### The more you have to manage, the more likely you'll want to automate your processes. PowerShell is the scripting language that will make you truly effective at managing lots of servers. But it's more than just a scripting language - it's an interactive shell that stores data for you and allows you to implement ad-hoc solutions quickly and easily. Within the PowerShell environment you can easily manage both SQL Server instances and the Windows servers themselves, giving you a 'best of both worlds' environment that puts you in control. This session will introduce you to PowerShell and show you how to use it to manage SQL Server across many instances.
