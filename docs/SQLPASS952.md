# SQL Server Administration Made Easy with dbatools  
#### [Back to calendar](#id-952)
Event Date: 04-11-2019 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (Full Day) - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker(s): Rob Sewell
## Title: SQL Server Administration Made Easy with dbatools  
## Description:
### Automation - When you are responsible for a number of SQL Instances automating tasks is vital.
Consistency - When a script run it will do the same thing every time. It won't forget to copy the WHERE clause into the query!
Expertise - Gaining more knowledge, developing skills and being able to improve your productivity will have a positive bearing on your career. 

dbatools is an open-source cross-platform PowerShell toolkit for SQL Server DBAs. With over 150 contributors from the SQL and PowerShell communities, dbatools is designed and written by the people who use it in their everyday work. If you want to learn how to use it you come and spend a day with Rob Sewell, one of the dbatools contributors and co-author of dbatools in a Month of Lunches.  

You will learn many practical examples of how dbatools can help you to save time in your DBA administration duties including: 
- Creating Availability Groups  
- Syncing Agent Jobs and Logins between replicas    
- Finding SQL Instances on your estate    
- Working with Central Management Server    
- Disaster Recovery   
- Backup Testing    
- dbatools and Azure- Simple instance migrations    
- Complex instance migrations    
- Tracking Activity    
- Working with other community tools with dbatools    
- Encompassing dbatools in DevOps    

Even better, you will be able to ask questions, meet other people and learn together and make connections that will be of benefit in the future as you take this knowledge and use it in your day to day work. 

Learning to use dbatools will also teach you how to use PowerShell and PowerShell interacts with many technologies so you will also be gaining knowledge that you will be able to make use of when you are faced with interacting with other technologies. 

This day-long session will be of benefit to any level of DBA looking after estates with one or more instances who have a little knowledge of PowerShell.

## Speaker(s): Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Database Privacy and Security for Developers
## Description:
### Oh, look... another data breach. And another. And another. Hardly a day goes by without a mention of one in the media. Thousands were reported last year, and thousands more didn't make the news. Size, industry, location - none of these are a determining factor anymore. We're all at risk, from malicious actors, insiders, even accidents. And more and more, the weaknesses that are being exploited are found not in the operating system, or the browser, or the network, but in the applications we create and manage.

So, developers... what are you going to do about it? 

In this one-day session, we're going to discuss a range of topics that developers need to know in order to improve their applications' data security and privacy. We'll cover SQL injection, one of the most common exploits over the last twenty years, in-depth, along with other common vulnerabilities. We'll talk about how to apply permissions and encryption properly in SQL Server to directly protect your data. We'll see how the new class of privacy regulations, including Europe's GDPR and California's CCPA, impact your business - no matter where your company is based. And we'll discuss what you're likely to encounter as your company moves toward a culture of data privacy.

## Speaker(s): Erin Stellato
## Title: Performance Tuning With Query Store in SQL Server
## Description:
### Have you upgraded to SQL Server 2016 or higher, but still have databases using the old Cardinality Estimator?

Do you know that you have queries with inconsistent performance, but you're just not sure how to find them, or fix them, quickly?

Are you tired of flailing around in SQL Server, querying DMV after DMV to figure out the *real* problem with performance?

Query Store can help.

We’ll cover Query Store end-to-end in this full day workshop built using real-world examples based on customer issues resolved over the last 2+ years. You'll understand how to configure it, what data it captures, and how to use it to analyze performance, find regressions, and force plans. The demos will teach you how to find common patterns in query performance using T-SQL, and how to understand your workload.

This class is applicable for those running SQL Server 2016 or higher (or planning to upgrade), or Azure SQL Database, and will provide practical and applicable information you can use whether you're a new or veteran DBA, a developer that has to troubleshoot query performance, or an application administrator just trying to keep the system afloat. You'll learn how to find and leverage important information in Query Store to make solving common performance problems easier the moment you walk back into the office.

## Speaker(s): Itzik Ben-Gan
## Title: Mastering T-SQL Querying Fundamentals
## Description:
### Does your work involve interacting with Microsoft SQL Server or Azure SQL Database? If so, writing T-SQL code is probably an integral part of your work. As a developer, DBA, analyst, BI pro, data scientist, or power user, a strong mastery of T-SQL querying and its foundations makes you better at what you do. This full-day seminar provides you with such strong foundations. You will naturally learn about T-SQL querying tools like joins, subqueries, table expressions, recursive queries, APPLY, set operators and many others. You will learn about logical query processing, which defines the conceptual interpretation of queries, unveiling many surprising things about T-SQL. You will learn about new T-SQL features that were added in recent versions of SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. You will also learn about common bugs and pitfalls, and ways to avoid those. As time permits, the seminar will also cover some of the more advanced querying tools like pivoting and unpivoting, window functions and grouping sets. This seminar will help you write correct and robust T-SQL code, avoid bugs, follow best practices, think in set-based/relational terms, and get a better mastery of T-SQL querying.

## Speaker(s): David Klee
## Title: Advanced Virtual SQL Server Performance 
## Description:
### Virtualization is the new norm in datacenters. Even the ubiquitous “cloud” is nothing more than virtualized servers in someone else’s datacenter with advanced automation on top of it. However, just because it’s everywhere doesn’t mean it is implemented and managed correctly. Done incorrectly, your SQL Server performance can take a massive dive. Are your SQL Servers running at their best possible performance?

This full-day boot camp covers all aspects of performance engineering for virtualized SQL Servers. We will review critical topics such as virtualization layers, VM construction, NUMA, resource scheduling, query parallelization and physical server alignment, “right-sizing,” and storage performance-oriented presentation. Availability and disaster recovery guidelines will also be reviewed. Most importantly, this seminar informs you on methods and terminology to help you work better with your infrastructure team to streamline your critical SQL Server performance. You will understand how to review your critical SQL Servers for both their performance and availability as they relate to the virtualization and physical compute layers underneath, and work with your infrastructure team to implement and streamline any of your findings.

## Speaker(s): Kevin Feasel
## Title: Architecting a Big Data Analytics Solution with SQL Server 2019
## Description:
### Over the past decade, the dual themes of Big Data and Data Science have stretched out the data platform space in two separate directions: one toward the accumulation of larger, more varied sources of data; and the other toward more and better predictions of future behavior.  

These two, separate themes are now coming together as the need for better predictions depends on the collection of more and better data. In this full-day training, you will learn about the tactics and techniques surrounding Big Data Analytics, particularly on the Microsoft stack. We will architect a solution for a real data science problem using the technologies central to SQL Server 2019, particularly around Big Data Clusters.  We will investigate the key components and uses of Big Data Clusters as well as PolyBase and SQL Server Machine Learning Services, seeing how these interrelate to solve data science problems at scale. In addition to core SQL Server technologies, we will learn about Apache Spark and Spark Streaming outside of Big Data Clusters, seeing how we can use these technologies to collect, curate, and enrich data for analytics.  Bringing the analysis home, we will use Azure Data Studio and its addition of Jupyter Notebooks, letting us write our code using R, Python, and even T-SQL.  By the end of the day, you will have an understanding of how to scope and design a Big Data Analytics project from beginning to end.

Event Date: 05-11-2019 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (Full Day) - Track: Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing
## Speaker(s): Terry McCann, Simon Whiteley
## Title: Practical Azure Databricks: Engineering & Warehousing at Scale
## Description:
### You've probably heard the buzz - there's a thing called Azure Databricks that is going to solve all your problems? Surprisingly, it just might. First and foremost, knowing how to use Apache Spark will earn you more money. It is that simple. Apache Spark has been the biggest thing in Big Data processing for many years now, but it has always felt inaccessible to the humble Microsoft data developer. Azure Databricks takes the Spark engine and makes it really, really easy. Data Engineers who know Apache Spark are in massive demand and we're going to introduce you to the skills required to succeed.

In the morning we will introduce Azure Databricks then discuss how to develop in-memory elastic scale data engineering pipelines. We will talk about shaping and cleaning data, the languages, notebooks, ways of working, design patterns and how to get the best performance. You will build an engineering pipeline with Python, then with Scala via Azure Data Factory, then we'll get it into context in a full solution. We will also talk about Data Lakes - how to structure and manage them over time in order to maintain an effective data platform. 

We will then shift gears, taking the data we prepared earlier and enriching it with additional data sources before modelling it in a relational warehouse. We will take a look at various patterns of performing data engineering to cater for scenarios such as real-time streaming, de-centralised reporting, rapidly evolving data science labs and huge data warehouses in specialised storage such as Azure SQL Datawarehouse. By the end of the day, you will understand how Azure Databricks sits at the core of data engineering workloads and is a key component in Modern Azure Warehousing.

# Bigger Hardware or Better Code and Design?
#### [Back to calendar](#id-952)
Event Date: 05-11-2019 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (Full Day) - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker(s): Jonathan Kehayias
## Title: Bigger Hardware or Better Code and Design?
## Description:
### Whether you are running SQL Server in the cloud or on-premise, more hardware often becomes the first answer to performance problems. The cost of scaling up in effort is relatively low, especially in the cloud where changing resource sizes is only a drop down option away, but financially this can quickly become a deal breaker.  Even the fastest hardware won’t keep up with bad design and coding patterns.  

This session will  take a look at many of the new features of SQL Server and how they can best be leveraged for performance tuning your workload.  From In-Memory OLTP to Columnstore Indexes, Query Store, and Extended Events, this session will guide you in finding the source of the problems, and solutions available to make your workload faster and consistently reliable. We’ll even take a look at different alternatives using older features of SQL Server that you may be leaving on the shelf that are a better fit to solving certain kinds of problems.

## Speaker(s): Kendra Little, Steve Jones
## Title: How to Architect Successful Database Changes: Source Control and Release Patterns for Performance and Availability 
## Description:
### You want to frequently release quality database changes while maintaining high performance and availability standards, but how do you do it? While the term ‘DevOps’ has just turned 10 years old, database architects and DBAs have been developing patterns and practices to standardize and automate delivery of database code quickly and reliably for far longer.  
 
In this session, you will learn how to choose between state and migrations-based approaches to database code management in source control on a per-project basis, and what this choice means for your release practices. You’ll learn what release automation means for ‘rollbacks’ with database code and get to join the debate on the pros and cons of different approaches to handling post-release disasters in production. We’ll discuss release patterns and how to measure success, including the blue/green deployment model when applied to databases, the expand/contract pattern, feature flags, and special cases for releases including replication, Azure SQL Database, and Managed Instances. Finally, we’ll cover how to identify and architect changes which require extra review and special design, including size of data operations and data modifications which need extra care.  
 
You’ll leave this day-long session with an understanding of the patterns that real-world professionals use to standardize and automate successful releases to production, and the tools and resources to design, test, and automate successful changes for even the most critical databases.

## Speaker(s): Ike Ellis
## Title: Move a Successful Legacy On-Premise OLTP SQL Server Database to Azure
## Description:
### You never thought you'd have to move this large, OLTP database to the cloud.  After all, the database has been running your business just fine for 20 years.  It has 20 years worth of dependencies:  linked servers, finance runs Excel projections directly from it, other databases connect directly to it, reporting, ETL, vendor extracts, FTP file uploads, and about 20 different internal applications all use that database as their main data source.    How could this possibly go to the cloud?   

Then one day your boss comes in the room and says "Management has made the unilateral decision that everything goes to Azure.  Everything.  And we have 18 months.  Make a plan to get that database into Azure."

After the initial shock wears off, you roll-up your sleeves and say "I'm ready for this challenge!  I can do this!  But where do I begin?  There are so many choices.   How do I know I'm making the right ones?"

You also know that the existing application has acquired significant technical debt over time.  Is this a good time to pay off that technical debt?  If it is, how do we accomplish that?  If it isn't how do I create a plan to pay it off in the future?

I know the mountain seems high, but you can climb it!  This session will tell you everything you need to know about moving that database to Azure. 

Here's what we will cover:
- How to choose between Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL DB Managed Instance, SQL Server in an Azure VM, CosmosDB, or Azure SQL DB Hyperscale
- How to know what needs to be refactored, re-written, or can move in place
- How to handle all the years of dependencies that have built up over time
- How to migrate the actual data, even it it's really large, from on-premise to Azure
- How to coordinate with other teams to handle networking, latency, security, and infrastructure
- How to run tooling to determine product compliance and compatibility
- Options for what to do when you know certain components cannot move to Azure.  
- How to create a hybrid cloud solution
- How to pay off years of technical debt
- How to change the application in the futures so that it more easily fits patterns that we know are cloud-scale

Come to the demo and lab-filled session and get all the tools necessary to perform a successful cloud migration project.  You can do this!  Let's get you on your way!

* Note to attendees: please bring a laptop that can use RDP to participate in the lab portions of this session.

# SQL and MongoDB: When Two Worlds Collide
#### [Back to calendar](#id-952)
Event Date: 06-11-2019 10:15 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Big Data
## Speaker(s): Eric Peterson
## Title: SQL and MongoDB: When Two Worlds Collide
## Description:
### Are you aware of the SQL and NoSQL worlds, but don't know why you would use both in the same sentence, let alone implement a hybrid solution? And then if you did want to set up such a system, where would you start?

After a quick overview of the SQL and NoSQL differences, we'll look at some scenarios where it makes sense to set up a hybrid environment to take advantage of the strengths of each database. Then we'll look specifically at accessing MongoDB from SQL Server.

Microsoft offers native integration with MongoDB in SQL 2019. We'll look at the mechanics of how to leverage that integration to archive data, feed a web farm, and provide more data to BI reporting.

We'll dig into querying normalized SQL and denormalized document db data structures simultaneously, and what that means for both data consistency and performance. Of course, this discussion wouldn't be complete without also knowing how to write to the document world from the relational world, so we'll cover that as well.

## Speaker(s): John Morehouse
## Title: Journey to the Cloud: Planning the First Steps
## Description:
### Every journey begins with a single step. This is true with any type of information technology project and moving to the cloud is no exception. With a cloud migration journey, that first step should be determining how to get there with a solid migration plan. 
 In order to build this migration, there are a lot of questions that need to be answered. Questions like “Who needs to be involved?”, “What region do we use?”, “How long will it take?”, and “What will it cost?” are a good starting point. While all of these questions can be overwhelming, forming a solid migration plan isn’t as hard as you’d think. 

In this 75-minute session, we will help you answer these questions as we travel through the process of starting to create a solid migration plan. As we reach wrap up and reach our destination, you can take the answers and continue your journey to the cloud by attending the follow up session, “Choosing Your Cloud: Step 2 In Your Cloud Migration Journey”.

# SQL Isn’t for Analysis: Why Everyone Needs OLAP Data Models
#### [Back to calendar](#id-952)
Event Date: 06-11-2019 10:15 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker(s): Rob Collie
## Title: SQL Isn’t for Analysis: Why Everyone Needs OLAP Data Models
## Description:
### In the world of data, everyone understands two fundamental truths:  you have to store data, and you have to visualize it.  Yes, you may have to perform some calculations, but those tasks generally fall to the storage layer (typically SQL) – and the results are then fed to the visuals in an “as-is” state.

Attendees of this talk will explore why this “storage and charts” mentality, while certainly pervasive, misses something spectacularly valuable:  the power of a middle-tier modeling and calculation layer. Rob Collie will share lessons learned over two decades in the world of data. In this talk he will share case studies and clear explanations of why the middle tier creates value that would be impossible with the traditional two-tier model.

# Failure Prediction for Manufacturing Industry with SQL Server & R
#### [Back to calendar](#id-952)
Event Date: 06-11-2019 10:45 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Andrea Martorana Tusa
## Title: Failure Prediction for Manufacturing Industry with SQL Server & R
## Description:
### Working in manufacturing industry means that you must deal with product failures. As a BI or Data Scientist developer, your task is not only monitor and report product’s health state during its lifecycle, but also predict the likelihood of a fail in the production or delivery phase.? 
Machine Learning techniques can help to accomplish this task. Starting from past failure data, we can build up a predictive model to forecast the likelihood for a product to fail or giving an estimate on its duration. And now it is possible to develop an end-to-end solution in SQL Server, because of the introduction of advanced analytics tools like R since release 2016.
In this session, we start from the real case of a manufacturing company to create some predictive models: a) regression model; binary classification model, random forest.  
The solution is built using SQL Server 2016, R and R services. On top of that, some reports are created to deliver the outcome to stakeholders

Event Date: 06-11-2019 13:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Big Data
## Speaker(s): Ben Weissman
## Title: Introducing SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters
## Description:
### In the realm of data storage and processing, there are two major technologies which we deal with every day. On one side, we have relational data that is stored inside SQL Server, and on the other side, non-relational or very large datasets that do not fit the relational model which are stored on big data clusters like Hadoop or Spark. 
This introduces challenges when having to combine datasets across both these technologies. SQL Server was never built to process huge datasets in a distributed fashion or to handle non-relational data very well, meaning that in many cases you would have to resort to bringing your relational data into Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
SQL Server 2019 has the answer with Big Data Clusters: it combines SQL Server with HDFS and Spark!

In this session we are going to explore the capabilities of the exciting new feature called SQL Server Big Data Clusters. How does it work and how can we work with datasets that are non-relational?

## Speaker(s): Kevin Kline
## Title: Successfully Communicating with Peers and Colleagues
## Description:
### What sets apart the most credible, trusted, and influential members of an IT team from the rest? What habits and behaviors do they exhibit that result in being treated with respect, while other team members of equal technical skill on the same team are virtually ignored? While data professionals are often analytical and data-driven in our work, we are rarely systematic about interpersonal communication and soft skills. This session will teach you how to bridge those gaps. 

One of the most fundamental practices among successful data professionals is self-awareness. We will help, through personality profiles like DISC, MTBI, and StrengthFinder, to reveal your own preferences, strengths, and weaknesses. With that foundation, we move to best practices in communication, such as listening and questioning skills. Finally, we cover a variety of difficult conversations and common conflicts and the communication techniques that help navigate those situations successfully. 

These lessons, in turn, build your confidence and influence in interpersonal situations, while enabling you to personally achieve new heights of productivity and greater personal effectiveness.

## Speaker(s): Erland Sommarskog
## Title: Packaging Permissions in Stored Procedures
## Description:
### Have you ever been in the situation where you want a user to be able to perform a privileged action, but you do not want to grant the user the permission needed, because that would permit the user to do a lot more? Maybe you have tried putting the action in a stored procedure, and if it is just a matter of plain DML, that works. But, you find that there are many situations where it fails; for instance when server permissions are needed. Or, for that matter, when your procedure uses dynamic SQL. 

In this session, you will learn how you can package database or server permissions in a stored procedure in a very fine-grained way, by using certificate signing or the EXECUTE AS clause. You will learn that one is better than the other, and that for server permissions, certificate signing is the only choice. As a side note, you will learn why making a database TRUSTWORTHY is a security risk. In the session materials you will get some scripts for automating certificate signing.

## Speaker(s): Erin Stellato
## Title: Understanding Execution Plans
## Description:
### If you have struggled to understand why a query takes too long to execute, or don’t know where to start when a query requires a lot of I/O or consumes significant CPU, then we should talk about execution plans. When you write a query for SQL Server, you are asking the engine to return a specific set of data, but the optimizer decides how to get that information; an execution plan provides details about what SQL Server decided to do, and it’s a great place to start to understand why a query may not perform as you hoped or expected. 

This session will include numerous demos that show:
- How to capture an execution plan
- How to understand what objects are being accessed
- The basic operations in a plan

In the demos we will also highlight other valuable information in a plan and how to identify potential problems. You will leave the session with practical information about execution plans that you can put to use immediately when you’re back at your desk and looking at a query that just didn’t run the way you anticipated.

## Title: Azure SQL Database Managed Instances: A Beginner’s Guide – the Pros, the Cons, and the Gotchas
## Description:
### Migrating your instance from on-premise to PaaS can seem like a leap too far for many DBAs. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt can consume any business, financial or technical advantages that might be gained as you worry about what, and how many, changes would be required to ensure the databases and applications continue to perform and function as designed.

Azure SQL Database and Azure Managed Instance are marketed as a cloud offering that allows DBAs to lift-and-shift their on-premise SQL Server instances to the cloud with minimal changes required to the application and database while giving you all the benefits of PaaS. An Azure Managed Instance is essentially a cloud-based version of an on-premise SQL Server instance. Databases share resources allocated to the Managed Instance and the databases in the instance are managed collectively. This is appealing to DBAs as it is familiar and reduces the learning curve involved, as well as reducing the risk of incorrectly sizing your PaaS environment.

In this session, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages Azure Managed Instances have over the other PaaS offerings and on-premise, the different sizing and offerings, and the inevitable gotchas that we incur when tackling a significant migration such as this.

Have you cringed at the thought of creating triggers to capture data changes for analysis in the future? Looking at a new feature in SQL 2016 called Temporal Tables gives you the ability to create a table that automatically keeps track of your data in time. Magic was never meant to be part of IT, but SQL Server has done a great job with this new feature. You will learn how to set it up on a new table or an existing table, how it works in practice, and querying the tables including the history table using new syntax. Coverage of version 2016 through what is coming in SQL 2019, including Retention Policies. Join me in a time travelling adventure to find out how you can leverage Temporal Tables in your world.

## Speaker(s): Andrea Martorana Tusa
## Title: Spatial Analysis with SQL Server, R and Power BI 
## Description:
### Everything in our world is located “somewhere” and is related to other things. Spatial analysis consists of studying these relationships. For example, you’re looking to open a new store. It's not only a matter of “where”, but there are also more implications: accessibility, parking availability, competitors, distribution, etc. Spatial analysis can help us in collecting, comparing, and matching data for rating choices. SQL Server supports spatial data type and new amazing features are offered with the addition of R for performing spatial analysis. Last but not least, Power BI offers a full range of maps - good visuals for performing spatial analysis, or for creating custom shape maps. And R scripts naturally. 

In the session, we will show how the joint use of these three tools empowers us to analyze and query the spatial properties of data, by showcasing a real-world example. Come, have fun, and discover a world of information inside your data with spatial analytics!

## Speaker(s): Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: A Game of Hierarchies: Graph Processing with SQL Server 2019
## Description:
### Hierarchies and graphs are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Bill of Material
* Networks
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are mostly sort of awkward. The most flexible hierarchies are usually modeled as self-referenced tables. If you want to successfully query such self-referenced hierarchies, you will need either loops or recursive Common Table Expressions. SQL Server 2017 came with a different approach: Graph Database, which are further improved in SQL 2019.
Join this session for a journey through best practices to transform your hierarchies and graphs into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous “Game of Thrones”.

## Speaker(s): Natasha Balac
## Title: From Data Munging to Wrangling - 7 Steps to Mastering Data Preparation for Data Science
## Description:
### Data is at the heart of all Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Data is crucial in training, testing, validating, and evaluating machine learning algorithms. As the popularity of AI/ML continues to rise due to the combination of plentiful cloud computing and the availability of big data to train machine learning models, so does the need for good quality data. The more quality data used to train the algorithms, the higher predictive power trained machine learning models can deliver. This is why there are numerous studies, surveys, and reports indicating that most data scientists spend the majority (as high as 80%) of their time on data preparation and cleaning data.

Data cleaning and preparation is a critical step in any machine learning project. Preparing data judiciously and accurately is crucial in order to enable successful machine learning projects. Before utilizing data to train a machine learning model, it’s important to ensure that it is clean, consistent, and accurate. 
   
In this session, we will provide an overview of steps and techniques for sourcing, preparing, transforming, and cleaning data for data science projects, and best practices for building effective data preparation implementation.

## Speaker(s): Shawn Meyers, Rob Girard
## Title: A new Breed of Storage for SQL Server – Level up your DevOps!
## Description:
### The best test infrastructure perfectly mimics production. Lowering the time to refresh data and time to run tests while increasing concurrency of tests leads to faster and more accurate development. Isolation is key to safe testing, but often leads to a great divide between how closely test & staging environments resembles your production environment. And without that isolation, the risks of something as simple as a wrong path in a script can easily bite you when it hits the wrong environment…. you didn’t need that production data anyway, did you?

Refreshing your development databases doesn’t have to be a complex operation and should be an easy option for DBAs to perform on their own. This should be extremely fast and non-impactful to both Prod and Dev systems. Don’t let the size of your data sets dictate the time it takes to refresh; and don’t take shortcuts in testing that could jeopardize your live data set. 

The right infrastructure & software are at the heart of an efficient DevOps strategy. Virtualization and automation technologies make possible what was a mere dream in not too distant past. This session will shed light on new technology to include in your DevOps toolkit; technologies that enable simple & efficient automation workflows. Learn about past, current and future storage technologies available and what next-gen storage infrastructure can enable within your organization. 

Tips and tricks shared in this session can be used to augment and improve what you do today, allowing you to keep up with what’s around the corner tomorrow. Stop supporting your infrastructure and let your infrastructure support you!

WARNING: Attending this session may lead to higher expectations of how your infrastructure should be supporting you.

## Speaker(s): Vern Rabe
## Title: Query Optimization Statistics: Driving Force Behind Performance
## Description:
### When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important information at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain estimated summary information. 

In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues (how to find them, and how to solve them) that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys (the most prevalent statistics based performance killer?), skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information. There’ll be many examples, and even a stored procedure to help you find ascending keys. By applying the techniques we’ll discuss, you WILL see improved query performance.

## Speaker(s): Jonathan Dahlberg
## Title: Data for Good: Using Machine Learning to Improve Water Access in Developing Nations 
## Description:
### Around the world, nearly 25% of communal water points are non-functional. This challenge has been difficult to address at a global, national, or even local level, primarily due to a severe scarcity of data. About three years ago, the Water Point Data Exchange started tracking this data through the development of a global repository, and with nearly 500,000 water point data records across 40 countries to date, this now represents the largest open and harmonized water point dataset available. However, usage of water point data to improve decisions and ultimately water services is still in the very early stages. Most countries are operating in resource-constrained environments, and lack extensive technical resources to utilize this data to its maximum potential.

The Global Water Challenge (GWC) and DataRobot teamed up to solve this. The two organizations are leveraging automated machine learning to provide governments with insight to manage water access in their respective countries. To do this, the team converted messy, public data into an easy-to-use web-based tool to help governments identify and prioritize water points for repair, identify high risk water points, and determine the availability of water point access by region. While the technology powering the web app is complex, the information is easy to digest, and organized by simple hierarchical filtering. This ensures water managers from various communities, even those without technical training, can act on predictions and make use of the data in the most beneficial ways possible. 

This session will also highlight the initial results of the water access project, and its application to operations and policy in West Africa today.

# Into the Future with In-memory OLTP 
#### [Back to calendar](#id-952)
Event Date: 07-11-2019 13:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Development
## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Into the Future with In-memory OLTP 
## Description:
### In-memory OLTP, also known as Hekaton, is a game changer for many OLTP applications, allowing fast access to data with no locking or blocking. The initial version, introduced in SQL Server 2014, had so many restrictions on what tables could be placed in memory, and what programming constructs could be used with the data in those tables, that many people wouldn’t even consider using it. Starting in SQL Server 2016, many of those restrictions are starting to be removed and In-memory OLTP is much more robust. SQL Server 2016 also gave us the ability to build columnstore indexes on memory-optimized tables so that we could use them for analytical queries as well as for OLTP. There are very few scenarios now in which your table structure or SQL constructs used would be a contraindication to using In-memory OLTP. 

This session will explore the changes to Hekaton since its original implementation, including SQL Server’s ability to create memory-optimized system tables in SQL Server 2019.

## Speaker(s): Denise McInerney
## Title: Successfully Communicating with Your Customers
## Description:
### No matter what role you are in, your job is to satisfy your customers. But often in tech we struggle to do this, which negatively affects our projects and our careers.

One reason for this is poor communication. This session will explore why communication gaps exist and how to address them. 

We will start by answering the question: “Who are my customers?”. Communication gaps begin when we are not clear on who has a stake in the outcome of a project.

We will offer tips and techniques for communicating with non-technical stakeholders. 

We will examine the art of requirements-gathering, exploring how to unearth what a customer actually wants, and how to manage when they change their minds.

Once we have those requirements, we need to ensure the technical team understands them. This session will also discuss how to ensure nothing is “lost in translation.”

We will talk about how to keep stakeholders informed so as to avoid surprises and disappointment.

Throughout the session, we will emphasize an approach that turns customers into allies invested in your success and avoids an “us vs. them” mindset.

Technologists who effectively communicate with their customers are more valuable than those who do not. Come to this session to learn how to be a better communicator and more successful in your career.

# Amazon Aurora: Design Considerations for High Throughput Cloud-Native Relational Databases
#### [Back to calendar](#id-952)
Event Date: 07-11-2019 15:15 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker(s): Tobias Ternstrom
## Title: Amazon Aurora: Design Considerations for High Throughput Cloud-Native Relational Databases
## Description:
### Amazon Aurora is a relational database service for online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads offered as part of Amazon Web Services. In this session, Tobias Ternstrom describes the architecture of Aurora and the design considerations leading to that architecture. Tobias also discusses how the central constraint in high throughput data processing has moved from compute and storage to the network.

Aurora brings a novel architecture to the relational database to address this constraint, most notably by pushing redo processing to a multi-tenant scale-out storage service, purpose-built for Aurora. Tobias describes how this not only reduces network traffic but also allows for fast crash recovery, failovers to replicas without loss of data, and fault-tolerant, self-healing storage. Traditional implementations that leverage distributed storage would use distributed consensus algorithms for commits, reads, replication, and membership changes, and amplify the cost of underlying storage. Tobias describes how Aurora avoids distributed consensus under most circumstances by establishing invariants and leveraging local transient state. These techniques improve performance, reduce variability, and lower costs.

## Title: LIGHTNING TALKS 
## Description:
### Sessions and Speakers will include:

Michael Grayson - Support What?! SQL Server and MongoDB: A side by side "How To"
More and more companies are starting to invest in multiple database platforms and DBAs are needing to develop a skillset to support a mixed-database environment.  Database concepts are often the same between platforms, however, the “how” can be very different (and sometimes not that different at all!).  Starting with the basics and gradually moving into the more advanced, this talk will show you how to perform the same task in SQL Server and MongoDB.  

Kimberly StJacques - Introduction to SQL Server 2019 Enhanced PolyBase 
Do you have ETL processes pulling data from multiple data sources into a data warehouse so you can run reporting from a single source? SQL Server 2019 enhanced the PolyBase feature that was introduced in SQL Server 2016.  Come learn how the new PolyBase features enable you to generate reports on data stored in all of your data sources without the need of a physical data warehouse! This is a great introduction for the PolyBase beginner.

Jens Vestergaard - PBIRESTAPI, no time for spaces...
In this talk, we will be looking into managing our Power BI content using only the Power BI REST API. Examples will be provided in Powershell, which may require minute skills up front. What will be demoed: Can I take ownership of this Dataset? How do I refresh my Dataset? Is my Dataset refreshing on a schedule?

Paul Andrew - Using Azure DevOps for Azure Data Factory
DevOps as a process is here to stay and is typically a must have requirement for any data platform solution. But how does the concept translate to the technology when implemented? Sadly, the answer isn’t always straight forward. In this short session I’ll introduce how we can continuously integrate and deliver our cloud orchestration resource Azure Data Factory (ADF). We’ll discuss three options for getting our service JSON deployed to production using the popular Azure DevOps environment, previously known as VSTS, and think about the suitability of the Microsoft provided ARM templates for our highly dynamic orchestrator. Does the ADF portal UI really support the DevOps methodology? Can we confidently publish our pipelines? How should we handle the branching of our source code for ADF developers? The answers to these questions and more in this lightning session. 


Martin Catherall - Data Privacy and the Data Professional World
What are the consequences of a data breach – for both the victims and companies involved – and what does that mean for you as a data professional. As governments start to legislate more in an effort to protect the privacy of its citizens, the entire concept of data storage become more complex. We will see what is exactly legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation and how will it affect around the world.

# Self Service with a Logical Architecture: How to Consolidate Access to Fragmented Data without Additional Replication
#### [Back to calendar](#id-952)
Event Date: 07-11-2019 15:15 - Category: Partner Session (75 minutes) - Track: Data Platform Strategy
## Speaker(s): Pablo Alvarez
## Title: Self Service with a Logical Architecture: How to Consolidate Access to Fragmented Data without Additional Replication
## Description:
### Recent trends in data management have favored a fragmented data landscape. From the days of a traditional central EDW, that provided a curated, consolidated access to data, current data architectures have evolved in different directions: noSQL, data lakes in the cloud, SaaS apps like SFDC, Spark and data science, etc.

At the same time, self service initiatives have tried to create a simpler perspective on the data where empowered users can build their own intelligence without the constant help of IT. But how to bind these two perspectives together? Physical consolidation in a single system doesn't work anymore: volumes are too big, and built-for-purpose systems offer unique abilities that would be lost.

A logical approach is more feasible: a logical layer that connects different systems and exposes them as one. The complexity of the back-end systems is hidden from the end user, while security, governance and auditing are again centralized. Self service can then become a reachable goal.

In this session we will see how a data virtualization platform like Denodo provides the required capabilities to build such a layer, and bridge the gap between the modern IT infrastructure and the needs of the end users.

## Title: From Adaptive to Intelligent: Query Processing in SQL 2019
## Description:
### As announced in September 2018, SQL Server 2019 expands the "adaptive query processing" features of SQL 2017 and relabels them as "intelligent query processing". This name now covers many features, such as batch mode on rowstore, memory grant feedback, interleaved execution, adaptive joins, deferred compilation, and approximate query processing.

In this high-paced session, we will look at all these features and cover some use cases where they might help - or hurt! - you.

## Title: On-Premises Power BI and Reporting: Reporting Services 2019
## Description:
### On-premises reporting of Power BI is available for those not yet in Azure. The new Report Services (PBIRS) can be installed alongside a Reporting Services (SSRS) installation, or the SSRS installation reports can be combined with the new PBIRS. If that is confusing, come to this session for an explanation. 

This session will flow from installation and configuration to include the separate Power BI desktop installation. Reviewing the release schedule (every 4-5 months) shows that this is different than the monthly update for Power BI service. Next, example reports will be developed pointing out tips and tricks for reports used with on-premises features. The conclusion of the session will demonstrate the viewing of reports with PBIRS, plus managing security and data refreshes through the portal.

### We’ve entered the age of the cloud data warehouse, but why is it still so hard to manage? Snowflake will change the way you think about data warehousing. Snowflake decreases the administration and complexity overhead needed for a scalable data warehouse. All this without breaking the bank. 

Snowflake is a multi-cluster solution with complete separation of compute and storage. With the separation of resources, we can scale up and/or out compute at any time independent of storage. This also means that data loading tasks can run on separate compute from query tasks while accessing the same shared data resource and without contention. 

Discover how easy it is to create a cloud data warehouse that delivers performance, simplicity, concurrency and affordability with very little administration.

## Speaker(s): Pedro Lopes
## Title: SQL Server Migration: The Last Mile
## Description:
### The post-migration/upgrade step is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy and completeness, as well as uncover query performance issues with the workload, as it runs on the newer version of the Database Engine. This is especially critical when you upgrade from older SQL Server versions such as 2008/2008R2 to modern versions like SQL Server 2017/2019, and you want to leverage the latest query optimization features. The expectation is that the workload performance improves, but it’s possible that part of the workload actually regresses, noticeably due to changes in the Query Optimizer over the years. 

In this session, we will go over the recommended process to upgrade your database that minimizes risk, and what features we have available to automate this critical step (Query Store, Automatic Tuning, and QTA).

## Speaker(s): Asgeir Gunnarsson
## Title: What's Going On in My Power BI Environment?
## Description:
### As Power BI is a self-service tool, it can be hard for administrators to monitor it. Power BI is fast improving in this context but there still isn’t a consistent way of monitoring it. There are compliance, governance, performance, and implementation questions to consider. Who is creating content, how is it being distributed, what data is being used, how long does the refresh take and how is it changing, who has a trial license, and what report is the most used? These are just some of the questions you as an administrator of Power BI might want to get answers to. 

In this session, we will look at how you can find those answers by monitoring Power BI. We will look at the Power BI Audit log for usage, license, and other audit information. We will look at what the Power BI API can show us about data sets, refresh history, Enterprise Gateway information, premium capacity, and artifact inventory. The audience leave the session ready to start their own monitoring of all or some of the topics.

## Speaker(s): Bob Ward
## Title: Inside SQL Server on Kubernetes 
## Description:
### Containers are the new "virtual machines" and one of the hottest technologies in the industry. While containers compliment virtual machines and provide consistency, portability, performance, and availability, how do you deploy containers at scale? For many, Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, is the answer. 

In this session, we will dive deep into the Kubernetes platform and how SQL Server containers can be deployed, managed, and configured. You will see how SQL Server can take advantage of Kubernetes for "built-in" high availability, easy to deploy patching, and integration with Always On Availability groups. We will discuss deploying SQL Server in various popular Kubernetes distributions including but not limited to Azure Kubernetes Service, OpenShift, and kubeadm. This session assumes a fundamental knowledge of both SQL Server and containers. We will move fast, and go deep using demos as a method to learn SQL Server and k8s.

## Speaker(s): Rajnikant Tandel
## Title: Reduce Cost by Tuning Queries on Azure DBaaS
## Description:
### Poorly written queries on on-premise server slow down the server performance, but with Azure SQL Database, those queries not only degrade the performance, but also cost money. When you tune queries in Azure SQL Database, you might get an additional benefit of reducing resource demands, your application might be able to run at a lower compute size, and eventually you can reduce the cost. In any given SQL Server instance, there are likely 8 to 10 queries or stored procedures which are responsible for 80 to 90 percent of the server load. If you can identify these problem queries and tune them, you can make a significant impact on the overall performance of your database. 

This presentation will explain some simple techniques of tuning the queries and will demonstrate before and after performance differences.

### SQL Managed Instance offers the best combination of a fully managed cloud service and SQL Server compatibility. This makes it the recommended destination for migration of most SQL Server workloads to cloud. Over the last year, SQL Managed Instance has been much enhanced in terms of functionality, the networking and security setup has been simplified, and new purchasing options have brought lower entry points and economy-at-scale offers. The time to migrate is now, so start exploiting the increased productivity and cost savings that the managed cloud gives you. Come to the session to hear about the best practices of cloud migration, hear the latest enhancements of SQL Managed Instance and the future roadmap.

Event Date: 08-11-2019 09:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Development
## Speaker(s): Martin Cairney
## Title: Data Classification and Masking: the What and How of Data Protection
## Description:
### As organisations make greater use of their data assets across multiple systems and environments, there is an increased risk of exposing unmasked sensitive data. This is particularly a concern when regulations such as GDPR are also in play. 
 
However, copies of data used in dev/test or in analytics need to be an accurate representation of the primary data so omitting, or doing a simple replacement of sensitive values, may skew any results. 
 
This session will introduce tools and processes that can be used to help protect your data. It will firstly show how the Data Classification utility in SSMS and SQL Server can identify and categorize your sensitive data. We will then see how dynamic and static Data Masking can be used to either hide sensitive data from selected users or to completely replace specific classifications of data with new values that both protect the source and also ensure that the distribution of data values remains consistent for your test environments.

## Speaker(s): Ike Ellis
## Title: Data Modeling Trends for 2019 and Beyond
## Description:
### There is so much confusion on how to model decision-making data for analysis. The number of products and tools the average company uses to store data has exploded. The database vendors are competing and releasing features at an astounding rate. One vendor says one thing while another vendor says another thing.  The cloud vendors have also accelerated the pace of change. Do we still need a star schema?  Do we create aggregate tables?  How do we handle temporal data?  How should we create slowly changing dimensions? These things are creating a confusing atmosphere for the data modeler.    
 
It is true that data modeling has changed, but there is no need to throw out great practices that have served us for years and can continue to do so. This session will cover what has changed for data modeling, why it changed, and how to take advantage of those changes. Combine new thinking with classic data architecture and you will create great analytic and transactional systems for your data.

## Speaker(s): Glenn Berry
## Title: Hardware 301: Choosing Database Hardware for SQL Server 2019
## Description:
### Microsoft made some sweeping changes to their software licensing model for SQL Server 2012; moving from socket-based licensing to core-based licensing. This new licensing model alters much of the conventional criteria for hardware selection for database servers that will be running SQL Server 2012 and newer. This change still causes a significant amount of angst, with fears of huge increases in SQL Server licensing costs compared to older versions of the product. 

This session will cut through the uncertainty and hype to show you how to properly evaluate and choose your database hardware for usage with SQL Server 2016 and newer. You will learn how to choose hardware for different types of workloads and how to get the best performance and scalability for the lowest licensing cost, whether you are running in a physical or virtualized environment.

## Speaker(s): Tillmann Eitelberg, Frank Geisler
## Title: Reporting for Developers
## Description:
### Power BI and Reporting Services can both be addressed with different programming languages, but have fundamentally different developer stories.
SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) is fully integrated with Visual Studio to provide a comprehensive development environment and full support for Application LIfecycle Management. SSRS also provides a good API for automatic generation of mass reports. Power BI has more strengths in the management area, but offers fewer possibilities in the programmatic development of reports. Power BI in the embedded flavor offers previously unavailable functions in the integration of a comprehensive reporting platform into own applications.

In this session, we will take a detailed look at the possibilities offered by the different platforms. We show when and where each platform can best be used, whether on-premises or in the cloud. Using many examples and demos, we show which functions the individual platforms offer and which challenges await the developer.

## Speaker(s): Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: Deep Dive into Blocking and Deadlocks Troubleshooting
## Description:
### SQL Server Concurrency Model is, perhaps, the most confusing and least understood part of SQL Server Internals. Blocking issues and deadlocks occur unexpectedly and negatively impact performance and user experience in the systems. Nevertheless, this model is well-structured and easy to understand when you analyze it from lock types and their lifetime, and compatibility standpoints. 

This, two-part session will explain why blocking and deadlocks occur, and how to troubleshoot them in your environments. First, it will provide the overview of SQL Server Concurrency Model and describe SQL Server locking behavior and root-causes of typical blocking issues. Next, the session will discuss how to capture and troubleshoot them using standard SQL Server tools, and how to simplify the analysis using Blocking Monitoring Framework developed by Dmitri.

## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Hash Match, the Operator
## Description:
### SQL Server has a lot of different execution plan operators. By far the most interesting, and the most versatile, has to be the Hash Match operator. Hash Match is the only operator that can have either one or two inputs. It is the only operator that can either block, stream, or block partially. And, it is one of just a few operators that contribute to the total memory grant of an execution plan. If you ever looked at execution plans, you will have seen this operator. And, you probably have a rough idea of what it does. But do you know EXACTLY what happens when this operator is used? 

In this black belt session we will dive deep into the belly of the operator to learn how it performs. This is going to be a wild ride, so keep your hands, arms, and legs inside the conference room at all times; and please remain seated until the presenter has come to a full stop.

## Speaker(s): Kathi Kellenberger
## Title: Azure Machine Learning 101
## Description:
### There are several ways to create a machine learning model. You can use R or Python, or even other languages such as C#. Advanced coding skills are required no matter which language you choose. Once the solution is created, it’s often difficult to deploy.

Microsoft addresses those problems with Azure Machine Learning, or Azure ML. Azure ML has built-in transforms for cleansing and munging data. It also contains a variety of configurable machine learning models that can be used without coding. Deploying the model is easy, and users can link to it directly with Excel or a custom application can be written.

If you are experienced in machine learning, but haven’t seen Azure ML, or if you are curious about machine learning and data science, this session is for you.

## Speaker(s): Edwin M Sarmiento
## Title: Successfully Managing Upwards And Getting Your Boss On Your Side
## Description:
### Highly effective and productive IT teams are formed when members work together as a team.

But what if your boss/manager isn't being a team player? He doesn't trust you to get the job done. He micromanages every single detail of a project or a task. He lacks vision of what he wants in the team as a contribution to the organization. He makes you feel inferior and does not assign you more challenging tasks. He lacks creativity and innovation when this is what's really needed by the IT team.

Wouldn't it be great if your boss was on your side and the team could get amazing results, contributing to the growth and profitability of the organization? The team can deliver more projects, spur up innovations, and increase morale, so that you will be excited to go to work every single day.

This session talks about how to successfully and effectively manage upwards and get your boss on your side to improve team dynamics and performance. I'll share the S.I.T. Framework for effectively connecting not just with your boss, but your other colleagues as well. This step-by-step game plan can help you get your manager’s buy-in, even if you have never been a manager yourself.

Event Date: 08-11-2019 11:15 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker(s): Pinal Dave
## Title: Elementary! The Curious Case of Deceptive Query Optimizer
## Description:
### We will see two important case studies where the optimizer is obviously a criminal who has killed the query performance. We will carefully investigate inside the Query Optimizer together and attempt to understand why it often behaves in a manner which is beyond common sense. 

While we investigate our crime scene of poorly running query, we will come across many unusual and usual suspects, like - statistics, query hints, indexes, cardinality, and compatibility. 

Just like a true investigator, we will figure out why Query Optimizer is not a criminal, but rather a victim of circumstances. Before we end the session, we will have a revelation of the true culprits. 

The journey would not be an easy one, join only if you have a keen desire to solve the mystery and learn advanced level concepts of Query Optimizer.

## Speaker(s): Victor Isakov
## Title: Should I Move My Production SQL Server Workloads to Containers?
## Description:
### With the release of SQL Server 2016 Microsoft started on the journey of containerizing SQL Server's database engine. By the time Microsoft releases SQL Server 2019 you might get the impression that the Windows operating system and/or virtual machines have become second-class citizens of SQL Server; that you should be deploying SQL Server in Containers and/or Kubernetes in the future... Nothing could be further from the truth. 

In this session, we will examine the case of whether you should move your production SQL Server workloads to containers. Along the way we will examine the architectural difference and both the advantages and disadvantages of containerizing your production SQL Server workloads.

## Speaker(s): Russel Loski
## Title: Managing ETL Change Using BIMLScript
## Description:
### Change is constant, especially with source files. Health care claims data files change at least yearly. You develop an SSIS package to load the source file. You meticulously identify each of the columns and map them to the targets. Your package runs fine for months. Then the file format changes. Again, you tediously select each column, etc. Wouldn't it be nice to simply document the structure of the file, the file's metadata, and generate the SSIS from that metadata? Your users demand the documentation anyway. If the file changes, you simply change the metadata. 

To demonstrate such an approach, I import some US census data. I create the SSIS package using BIMLScript and metadata. When the format changes, I change the metadata and generate a whole new package. And if your whole ETL approach changes to say Azure Data Factory? I will demonstrate how to generate an Azure Data Factory pipeline from the same metadata.

## Title: Comparing Predictive Models from R, Python, SSAS, and Azure ML
## Description:
### There is a lot of overlapping in Microsoft BI suite. For advanced analytics, like data mining, you can use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), or R, or Python, or Azure ML. The question arises, which tool to use? The answer is simple, through another question: Why not all of them? 
In data mining, you typically create multiple predictive models for the same task, and then evaluate them to select the best one. So why wouldn’t you use different tools for different models? You will learn how to evaluate the predictive models, then you will see how to bring all of the mining models together and compare them no matter which source they come from. You will see how you can use SQL Server Integration Services, Excel, and other tools for this task.

### In this session, we will be looking into managing our Power BI content using only the Power BI REST API. While the Power BI REST API is extensive, we will be limiting this session on the following sections of interest: dashboards, datasets, reports, and groups.

How many dashboards are there in a workspace?
Which datasource is this dataset configured to use?
Who is allowed to see this report?
Can I take ownership of this dataset?
How do I refresh my dataset?
Is my dataset refreshing on a schedule?

Those are just some of the questions we will find the answers to.

Examples will be provided in Powershell, which may require minute skills up front. Not to worry, a quick intro will be provided as well.

Attending this session will make you familiar with the Power BI REST API and provide you with guidance on how to manage the most common tasks in Power BI.

## Speaker(s): MIKE DONNELLY, Jennifer McCown, Paul Wehland, Jorge Besada, Dennes Torres, Edward Pollack
## Title: LIGHTNING TALKS 
## Description:
### This Lightning Talk session will be comprised of six 10-minute talks on PowerShell, SQL Server Administration, Varchar(max), and more! 

Sessions and Speakers will include:

Michael Donnelly - Beyond the Database: Going Fullstack to Understand Developers
Data Professionals sometimes get trapped in our database bubble. Last year I got curious about technologies I’ve only heard about but never needed to use. I will share what I learned about becoming a full-stack engineer and how it has made me a better DBA. I’ll share why people like ORMs and why developers see the database as a small part of the puzzle. I will also provide information on resources to teach yourself all the technologies I learned. 

Jennifer McCown - Complete SQL Server Administration in Ten Minutes
In this talk, you will learn about the three essential maintenance tasks, and how the free Minion Maintenance suite makes handling these tasks effortless for DBAs who are new (or very busy!). We'll also talk about how deeply configurable the maintenance solution is, and set up a set of backup tuning configurations. Ten minutes will solve quite a lot of your maintenance problems!

Dennes Torres - Varchar(max) and Text: Hidden Secrets
Text field is deprecated and should be replaced by Varchar(max) fields. Are they both really the same? In this talk, I will show some interesting differences among these field types and how you can prevent performance problems when replacing Text by Varchar(max) fields

Jorge Besada - PowerShell From The Trenches - Workflows ...Of Course Yes! 
The PowerShell Workflows, you have seen them from afar in articles and decided it was too much trouble! I get it, I am describing my personal experience. But in reality, you just need to follow some simple (ok some not so simple) steps to start putting them to good use and augmenting your productivity at work by a big chunk ... which will make the Pointy Haired Boss happy

Edward Pollack - Memory-Optimized Table Variables in 10 Minutes
Using Memory-Optimized Table Variables allows for the creation, management, and disposal of temporary data completely within memory, without the need to store data on disk.  In this talk, Memory-Optimized Table Variables will be introduced, discussed, and demonstrated.  The most common use-cases for this feature will be introduced, as well as how they can allow you to overcome some of the limitations found in Natively Compiled Stored Procedures.  

Paul Wehland - 3 Tricks for Faster Index Maintenance on Availability Groups
Index rebuilds are a common task for DBAs.  But if you are on an Always-On Availability Group, your databases are in FULL Recovery mode.  This means that your index rebuild is fully logged, instead of minimally logged when in BULK_LOGGED recovery mode.  This makes for some slow index rebuilds and could risk over-running your maintenance windows. This talk will discuss 3 tricks to help speed your index rebuilds on Always-On Availability Groups.

Event Date: 08-11-2019 15:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker(s): Dan de Sousa
## Title: Azure Data Studio: The Challenger
## Description:
### Azure Data Studio is a light-weight, open source, cross-platform database management tool that does not require installation and can run from an external device. It was developed to run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS and supports platforms both on-premises and cloud. 

In this session, I will introduce the tool, its capabilities, its features and benefits, and a comparison to its main competitor, SQL Server Management Studio. Be aware that Azure Data Studio does not replace SSMS, and depending on the situation, environment, and requirements/tasks performed, they may work together. I will explain and demonstrate scenarios and which tool you would choose over the other. I will also cover the built-in monitoring functionality, dashboards, widgets and extensions, data export options, and notebooks.

# Secure SQL Server Database Design: Tactics and Technology
#### [Back to calendar](#id-952)
Event Date: 08-11-2019 15:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Security
## Speaker(s): Dan Mallott
## Title: Secure SQL Server Database Design: Tactics and Technology
## Description:
### When we design and build an application, do we think about security first or is it an afterthought? As we read about more and more data breaches, it is clear that we need to think security-first when designing and building our applications.

Where does design start for an application? It starts with the database layer. In this talk, we will discuss strategies for designing a more secure SQL Server database. We will start with simple design decisions for tables, views, stored procedures, and database roles that can improve security before moving on to talk about built-in SQL Server security technologies such as Always Encrypted, Row-Level Security, Dynamic Data Masking, Transparent Data Encryption, and SQL Server Audit. Lastly, we will finish up with some tips on how to retrofit security features onto existing databases and look at how data access from the application may need to change.

# Relational Data Modeling Trends for Transactional Applications
#### [Back to calendar](#id-952)
Event Date: 08-11-2019 15:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Cloud Solutions
## Speaker(s): Ike Ellis
## Title: Relational Data Modeling Trends for Transactional Applications
## Description:
### There is so much confusion regarding data modeling today. NoSQL solutions, Microservices, In-memory data stores, and cloud vendors have all combined to create a confusing atmosphere for the application data modeler. Is the EF Codd era over? Are we over or under normalized? How important is modeling to performance? Do we use the data model to enforce data integrity and business logic rules? Is it OK to repeat data?  

When EF Codd made the rules, he was under different constraints and had different priorities than we have. We need to understand the current constraints of the modern application and re-prioritize our design principles to accomodate them. We need to emphasis the ability to change the model to keep up with the rate of change that business is demanding of us. Come to this session to learn how to correctly model data in a fast-changing business application environment.
