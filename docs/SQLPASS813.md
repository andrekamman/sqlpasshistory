## Speaker(s): Janis Griffin
## Title: HiHo! HiHo! SQL Server on Linux, We Go!
## Description:
### SQL Server has been running on Windows for years. Now Microsoft is making it available on Linux in order to provide a consistent database platform across Window and Linux servers, as well as on-premises and in the cloud. In this presentation, Janis Griffin, database performance evangelist at SolarWinds, will discuss the advantages of using SQL Server on Linux, comparing architecture, cost and performance. Several demonstrations on installing and maintaining SQL Server on Linux will be shown along with an introduction of several useful Linux commands.

The participant will learn:
1. The advantages of using SQL Server on Linux, comparing architecture, cost and performance to Window servers.
2. How to install, maintain and backup SQL Server on Ubuntu Linux systems 
3. Several useful Linux commands to monitor/manage SQL Server

## Title: The SQL Server Availability Story on Linux
## Description:
### SQL Server 2017 is here, and so is its arrival on Linux. That means you need to also make instances and databases highly available on this new variant of SQL Server. Covering the availability story for SQL Server on Linux, this session will provide the inside scoop on where it is similar and where it is very different from deploying under Windows Server. You will also get tips and tricks for SQL Server availability configurations from the guy who helped Microsoft write the availability documentation for SQL Server on Linux.

## Speaker(s): Anthony Nocentino
## Title: Monitoring Linux Performance for the SQL Server Admin
## Description:
### So you’re a SQL Server administrator and you just installed SQL Server on Linux. It’s a whole new world. Don’t fear, it’s just an operating system. It has all the same components Windows has and in this session we’ll show you that. We will look at the Linux operating system architecture and show you where to look for the performance data you’re used to! Further we'll dive into SQLPAL and how it architecture and internals enables high performance for your SQL Server. By the end of this session you’ll be ready to go back to the office and have a solid understanding of performance monitoring Linux systems and SQL on Linux. We’ll look at the core system components of CPU, Disk, Memory and Networking monitoring techniques for each and look some of the new tools available including new DMVs and DBFS.

## Title: Linux for the SQL Server DBA
## Description:
### Times are certainly changing with Microsoft’s recent announcement to adopt the Linux operating system with the SQL Server 2017 release, and you should be prepared to support it. But, what is Linux? Why run your critical databases on an unfamiliar operating system? How do I do the basics, such as backing up to a network share or add additional drives for data, logs, and tempdb files?

This introductory session will help seasoned SQL Server DBAs understand the basics of Linux and how it differs from Windows, all the way from basic management to performance monitoring. By the end of the session, you will be able to launch your own Linux-based SQL Server instance on a production ready VM.

## Title: Essential Linux for the SQL Server DBA
## Description:
### Linux has come to Microsoft! Do you want to gain the knowledge that Oracle DBAs have been using for years to manage their databases on this valuable OS?
This session is taught by a multi-platform DBA who specializes in Oracle and SQL Server with almost two decades on Unix/Linux experience.  The goal is to give you the most valuable fundamentals and commands that are important to the DBA when managing a database in a Non-Windows environment. 
We’ll learn:
1.    Linux history and concepts.
2.    Important differences between systems
3.    Crucial commands to get around 
a.    Navigating, searching and managing
b.    Monitoring, tracing and updating
c.     Editing and scripting

You’ll leave feeling more at ease with Linux and have plenty of content and links to continue the learning after the session!
