Event Date: 08-05-2012 08:30 - Category: Pre-Cons (7 hours) - Track: Professional Development (PD)
## Speaker(s): Kevin Kline
## Title: Leadership and Team Management Skills for the Database Professional
## Description:
### Most IT leaders earned their promotions based on technical competency, not on leadership or managerial skills. Technical leaders rarely advance into leadership positions with the complex mix of social and soft skills that best facilitate their success and the success of their teams. Successful IT leaders must earn the respect of their team and have a deep understand of effectively motivating technology professionals as well as specific skills to lead database professionals competently.

These skills broadly fall into the following categories: Coaching team members to meet goals and deadlines, facilitating change and navigating organizational disruptions, promoting communication within the team and with management, keeping teams and projects on task and within scope, dealing with difficult team members, and practicing good time management techniques. This seminar’s training content, fun exercises, and reference material equip attendees to further develop their leadership potential and achieve excellent results for themselves and for their teams.

Event Date: 08-05-2012 08:30 - Category: Pre-Cons (7 hours) - Track: Database Administration (DBA)
## Speaker(s): Denny Cherry
## Title: Storage for the DBA
## Description:
### One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage. It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language. In this full-day seminar, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives. We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID groups.

Event Date: 09-05-2012 08:30 - Category: Pre-Cons (7 hours) - Track: Database Administration (DBA)
## Speaker(s): Robert Davis, Argenis Fernandez
## Title: Demystifying Database Administration Best Practices 
## Description:
### Being able to evaluate and develop best practices is a critical skill for DBAs. Early in our careers, we followed best practices because people who claimed to know more about SQL Server told us to. Then we realized that for most best practices we found, we could find the opposite advice posted elsewhere. We started evaluating best practices ourselves and began cultivating our own set of best practices.

This workshop is a culmination of what we’ve learned through our experiences, testing, and understanding of how SQL Server operates. We will touch on best practices for all aspects of the DBA realm, from AD configuration to Windows Server deployments to SQL installs with configuration settings galore. We will cover the "why's" behind the best practices, tips to make your daily duties easier, and what to look for in code reviews. And we’ll show you how to evaluate best practices for yourself.

Event Date: 09-05-2012 08:30 - Category: Pre-Cons (7 hours) - Track: Business Intelligence (BI)
## Speaker(s): Greg Galloway
## Title: 99 Tips for Tuning and Enhancing Analysis Services
## Description:
### Come hear Greg Galloway share all his best tips for optimizing performance of Analysis Services and for improving the user experience and reach of your cubes. This session is targeted at BI developers responsible for maintaining Analysis Services cubes and to DBAs who are tasked with monitoring and troubleshooting Analysis Services issues. Expect to leave with an actionable checklist of ideas to try on Monday, when you return to work with a deeper grasp of the internals of Analysis Services, with MDX optimization experience, and with best practices that ensure your projects succeed. This pre-conference session will focus on Multidimensional cubes and MDX, but will briefly discuss the advantages and limitations of new Tabular models and DAX in Analysis Services 2012.

# Relational Database Design Workshop
#### [Back to calendar](#id-11)
Event Date: 09-05-2012 08:30 - Category: Pre-Cons (7 hours) - Track: Development (DEV)
## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Relational Database Design Workshop
## Description:
### Database design is a seemingly natural process, lending itself to everyone trying it, from an administrative assistant with a spreadsheet to a C# programmer with a copy of SQL Server Express. Unfortunately, the finer points of excellent database design are not intuitively obvious, and the difference between building a spreadsheet and a solid enterprise database is similar to the difference between building a dog house and a 2-story house, or even the Empire State Building. To design a database correctly, you need to understand basic relational theory, gathering and applying requirements, and normalization. But that’s only the start. In this workshop, we will go to the next level and get our hands dirty designing databases too.

We’ll begin with database design fundamentals, and design several databases as a class, in groups, and individually. Then we’ll dig into advanced topics on database design patterns and practices, with more design time.

Event Date: 10-05-2012 08:45 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: Database Administration (DBA)
## Speaker(s): Allen White
## Title: Gather SQL Server Performance Data with PowerShell
## Description:
### We all know how important it is to keep a baseline of performance metrics that allow us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  We don't always know how to do this easily and consistently.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.

# Tuning Analysis Services Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#id-11)
Event Date: 10-05-2012 08:45 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence (BI)
## Speaker(s): John Welch
## Title: Tuning Analysis Services Performance
## Description:
### You’ve got your Analysis Services cube created, and deployed in production. However, you notice that every night, the cube is taking longer and longer to process, and users are starting to complain about their data not being ready when they arrive in the morning. If you’ve found yourself in this situation, or want to avoid being in it in the first place, come to this session. We’ll cover how to benchmark processing performance, track down bottlenecks, and how to tune things to get the best performance for processing your cube.

# SQL Server Internals and Architecture
#### [Back to calendar](#id-11)
Event Date: 10-05-2012 08:45 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: Development (DEV)
## Speaker(s): Kevin Kline
## Title: SQL Server Internals and Architecture
## Description:
### Let’s face it, you can do many SQL Server tasks without knowing how SQL Server works. Many developers, DBAs, and designers do their day-to-day work on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes. But to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.

This fun and fast-paced session will answer questions like: What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems? What are the various areas of memory inside SQL Server? How are queries handled behind the scenes? What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers? How are IOs handled with regard to transaction logs and the database? What happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrink? And for those topics we don’t cover, we’ll point you to resources for more information.

# Upgrade Roadmap: Let’s Delve into SQL Server 2012
#### [Back to calendar](#id-11)
Event Date: 10-05-2012 08:45 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: SQL Server 2012 and Beyond (SS12)
## Speaker(s): Craig Purnell
## Title: Upgrade Roadmap: Let’s Delve into SQL Server 2012
## Description:
### We will review the upgrade process to SQL Server 2012. An upgrade is 75% project planning and 25% execution. Everyone knows that, right? Actually, no. We'll walk through a checklist of considerations a company would likely encounter coming from SQL Server 2005/2008 or R2, as well as the pros and cons of in-place upgrade vs. the build-new approach. There will be many real-world lessons learned from many upgrades and migrations of SQL Server. Key takeaways include: when to upgrade in place compared to build new, usage of and how to gauge the usefulness of Upgrade Advisor, and deprecated features and how to test for them.

## Speaker(s): Tim Ford
## Title: The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects
## Description:
### Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration, I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances. In navigating the table, we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, and system information will all be covered. We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yield interesting insights into your servers. We will also look at how things can also go awry - like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!

## Speaker(s): Denny Cherry
## Title: Using SQL Server 2012's Always On
## Description:
### In this session, we will look at the functionality provided with Microsoft SQL Server 2012 as part of the "Always On" features, including site-to-site configurations to allow a large-scale high availability solution without the need for any high-end SAN storage solution.

In addition, we will look at the ability to have redundant servers, which can be used for reporting or taking backups, reducing the load from the production database. We will also discuss a unique use case, using SQL Server 2012's Always On feature to scale out the reads to synchronous read-only copies.

## Description:
### Have you gotten tired of your 1TB database taking 4+ hours to back up? Are you sick of having your users breathe down your neck for 2 hours because it’s taking too long to restore a database? You don’t have to worry about that anymore. I’m going to show you some little known tricks, methods, and trace flags you can use to tune your backups just like you would a query. Backups actually have kind of an execution plan that you can access if you know how, and knowing how to get the individual portions of your backup process down will allow you to knock 80% and even more off of your backup and restore time. I’m not holding anything back in this session. This is a method I’ve used for 15 years to tune my backups, and I’ve had great success with it.

## Title: Advanced DDL Constraints (Community Pick)
## Description:
### Most SQL programmers do not use the full power of DDL and therefore have to put needless work into the application code and risk that two applications will not be in agreement. The optimizer can use the DDL but not procedural code, so this ignorance is expensive. 

This session will start with the basics: NOT NULL, DEFAULT, Simple CHECK(). We'll look at the choice of data types: DECIMAL and NUMERIC vs FLOAT and REAL, CHAR(n) vs VARCHAR(n), Unicode, and COLLATION. Then, we'll round out the session by discussing using CASE in CHECK() constraints, function calls in CHECK() constraints, WITH CHECK OPTION on VIEWS, DRI Actions, and State Transition tables.

## Title: Data Governance 101 - Environment, Space and Security (Community Pick)
## Description:
### Data governance is a set of processes that ensures that important data assets are formally managed throughout the enterprise. Come to this session and learn about simple things that can help DBAs "govern" their SQL environment, put the right data governance solution in place to help manage your environment in a proactive manner, and build your own meta data repository for all your SQL Servers. Since this is a vast topic, we will only cover environment, database/disk space, and security.

## Title: SSIS Performance Tuning (Community Pick)
## Description:
### Tuning the performance of Integration Services packages can be challenging. You have to consider not only the packages themselves, but also your database servers, file system, and system resources. During this session, we will cover a method for evaluating performance of your packages consistently, as well as scripts and utilities that support this method. We’ll also cover the top candidates for performance improvements in real world scenarios, and specific tuning that can be performed when you identify performance bottlenecks in SSIS. We'll also cover how SSIS 2012 impacts tuning.

## Speaker(s): Trevor Barkhouse
## Title: Deadlock Detection, Troubleshooting & Prevention
## Description:
### As an enterprise application grows and load increases, some concurrency issues are bound to surface. Deadlocks are one of the more aggravating of this class of problems. Fortunately, each release of SQL Server includes better tools for troubleshooting deadlocks. This session will provide a strong foundation on deadlocks and then demonstrate approaches for handling them in SQL Server 2000, 2005, and 2008/2008 R2.

## Title: Using Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012 (Community Pick)
## Description:
### Columnstore indexes in SQL Server 2012 will allow you to significantly improve the processing time of common data warehousing queries without creating cubes, aggregated tables, or other techniques normally used to improve performance. This session will show how to implement this new type of index in SQL Server and demonstrate their advantages compared to traditional solutions. It will also cover the scenarios for which columnstore indexes should be implemented to provide powerful but flexible BI solutions.

# What Sequence Objects Are (and Are Not)

Event Date: 11-05-2012 16:00 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: Development (DEV)
## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: What Sequence Objects Are (and Are Not)
## Description:
### SQL Server 2012 adds a new object to our arsenal called a sequence, which can give us the capability to implement automatically incrementing values. However, it cannot replace a lot of functionality that we have used a numbers table and windowing functions for (though they can be complementary to one another). In this session, I will demonstrate the uses and performance characteristics of sequences, including how they complement the use of number tables and windowing functions to create surrogate key and sorting values, and more.

## Speaker(s): Jennifer McCown
## Title: Unraveling Tangled Code – A Spellbinding Tale of Victory Over Chaos
## Description:
### Once upon a time, you inherited an application or a database that was filled with chaos and inconsistencies. The T-SQL code is overly complex and impossible to ken. The architecture is painful to behold, and grueling to code for. One might optimistically say that query performance is “spectacularly mediocre”. If you’re without good documentation or system architects to guide you, how do you break the curse of confusion? In this session you’ll learn several methods for conquering chaotic code, and how to seek and destroy some of the nastier coding mistakes and inefficiencies. We will break complicated queries into key pieces, turn them upside-down, and reform them into something sensible. We will vanquish major issues like data abuse and index negligence. We will restructure joins, tame subqueries, and refactor dynamic SQL. We will emerge victorious!

## Speaker(s): Robert Davis
## Title: TempDB: Performance and Manageability
## Description:
### Misconceptions and inconsistent advice on tempDB abounds - even highly skilled DBAs cannot always agree on how to best configure tempDB. Part of the problem is that there is no single solution that can be applied to every situation. How many files should tempDB have? Should it be on RAID 1? RAID 10? How about Solid State Drives (SSDs)? This session will give you the tools to determine the optimal configuration for tempDB. Also covered is how to detect, prevent, and monitor for common tempDB performance problems.
