# Data Internals
#### [Back to calendar](#id-28)
Event Date: 31-07-2013 05:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Bradley Ball
## Title: Data Internals
## Description:
### Often as DBAs, we learn backwards. You get a DBA job, and you have databases that have tables, which have data in them. Nobody tells you that there are records, stored on pages, grouped in extents, assigned by allocation bitmaps, with IAM pages and allocation units that span partitions and filegroups.

Today is your lucky day! This 24 Hours of PASS session will cover byte swapping and bitmaps and dive a little into decoding Hex and binary, working to give you an understanding of database internals and how you use them every day!

## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: Practical Performance Troubleshooting
## Description:
### You’re a developer or DBA stuck with a database server that's not going fast enough. You've got a hunch that the biggest bottleneck is inside the database server somewhere, but where? In this 24 Hours of PASS session, you'll learn how to use a powerful script to identify what your SQL Server is waiting on, and then you can focus on the queries (or settings) that are holding you back.

You'll learn:
• What SQL Server waits on when it's executing queries
• How to query DMVs to identify your server's bottlenecks
• How to identify the most common wait types and their causes

## Speaker(s): Christina Leo
## Title: Building Your T-SQL Tool Kit: Window Function Fundamentals
## Description:
### Have you pulled a script to identify duplicates from a blog post but couldn’t quite get it to work because you weren’t sure what that ROW_NUMBER() function was doing? Maybe you heard talk about creating running totals without using subqueries, but you got frustrated when the groups weren’t totaling correctly.

## Speaker(s): Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Discover, Document, and Diagnose Your Servers on Your Coffee Break
## Description:
### Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We know we should do it, but it's time-consuming; by the time you're finally done, it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week, and keeping documentation up-to-date can turn into a full-time job.
 
You need to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. In this 24 Hours of PASS session, you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches – all while on your coffee break. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: How to Design a Relational Database
## Description:
### Database design is a seemingly natural process, lending everyone to try to do it themselves, from an administrative assistant with a spreadsheet to a C# programmer with a copy of SQL Server Express. Unfortunately, the finer points of excellent database design are not intuitively obvious, and the difference between building a spreadsheet and a solid enterprise database is like the difference between building a doghouse and a two-story house, or even the Empire State Building.

In this 24 Hours of PASS session, we will look at some of the concepts and practices that go into designing a great database, using a mix of light theory and practical examples to help to make it clear that building a relational database is neither simple nor difficult once you understand the fundamentals.

## Speaker(s): Denny Cherry
## Title: Storage and Virtualization for DBAs
## Description:
### One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.

## Speaker(s): Audrey Hammonds
## Title: Design Matters! The Performance Impact of Database Design
## Description:
### Time-travel stories all have one common plot element: some action done in the past has a big impact on the future. Sometimes you get lucky...hoverboards! Sometimes, not so much...Morlocks! The same holds true in your application. Design decisions have a huge impact on how you’re going to get data into and out of your database. This 24 Hours of PASS session will illustrate the impact of database design on query performance and why thinking about performance during design time will help your database avoid an H.G. Wellsian future. Come learn a little database design, how to read an execution plan, and some unintended consequences of less-than-optimal design decisions.

## Speaker(s): Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Into the Blue: Extending AlwaysOn Availability Groups
## Description:
### For many organizations, having a second data center or co-location center doesn’t make sense, financially or logistically. Typically, this would limit options for building out a disaster recovery (DR) solution. However, now with Windows Azure virtual machines and SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups, you can connect your on-premise solution to a real-time secondary replica, providing read scalability and a solid DR solution.

This 24 Hours of PASS session will provide a discussion of the infrastructure requirements and gotchas involved in implementing a hybrid solution between your data center and Azure.

## Speaker(s): Glenn Berry
## Title: Scaling SQL Server 2012
## Description:
### SQL Server implementations can rapidly evolve and become more complex, forcing DBAs and developers to think about how they can scale their solution quickly and effectively. Scaling up is relatively easy but can be expensive, while scaling out requires significant engineering time and effort. As your database server nears its load capacity, what can you do?
 
This 24 Hours of PASS session, a preview of the full-day PASS Summit pre-conference session, will give you concrete, practical advice about how to scale SQL Server. We’ll explore how to find and alleviate bottlenecks and cover how you can decide whether you should scale up or scale out your data tier. We’ll also cover how to use middle-tier caching and other application techniques to increase your overall scalability.
