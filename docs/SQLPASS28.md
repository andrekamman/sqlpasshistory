## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: Practical Performance Troubleshooting
## Description:
### You’re a developer or DBA stuck with a database server that's not going fast enough. You've got a hunch that the biggest bottleneck is inside the database server somewhere, but where? In this 24 Hours of PASS session, you'll learn how to use a powerful script to identify what your SQL Server is waiting on, and then you can focus on the queries (or settings) that are holding you back.

You'll learn:
• What SQL Server waits on when it's executing queries
• How to query DMVs to identify your server's bottlenecks
• How to identify the most common wait types and their causes

## Speaker(s): Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Discover, Document, and Diagnose Your Servers on Your Coffee Break
## Description:
### Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We know we should do it, but it's time-consuming; by the time you're finally done, it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week, and keeping documentation up-to-date can turn into a full-time job.
 
You need to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. In this 24 Hours of PASS session, you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches – all while on your coffee break. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.

# How to Design a Relational Database
#### [Back to calendar](#id-28)
Event Date: 01-08-2013 05:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: How to Design a Relational Database
## Description:
### Database design is a seemingly natural process, lending everyone to try to do it themselves, from an administrative assistant with a spreadsheet to a C# programmer with a copy of SQL Server Express. Unfortunately, the finer points of excellent database design are not intuitively obvious, and the difference between building a spreadsheet and a solid enterprise database is like the difference between building a doghouse and a two-story house, or even the Empire State Building.

In this 24 Hours of PASS session, we will look at some of the concepts and practices that go into designing a great database, using a mix of light theory and practical examples to help to make it clear that building a relational database is neither simple nor difficult once you understand the fundamentals.

## Speaker(s): Denny Cherry
## Title: Storage and Virtualization for DBAs
## Description:
### One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage. It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language. In this 24 Hours of PASS session, we’ll look at storage from both the database and storage perspectives, digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, and RAID Groups.

## Speaker(s): Audrey Hammonds
## Title: Design Matters! The Performance Impact of Database Design
## Description:
### Time-travel stories all have one common plot element: some action done in the past has a big impact on the future. Sometimes you get lucky...hoverboards! Sometimes, not so much...Morlocks! The same holds true in your application. Design decisions have a huge impact on how you’re going to get data into and out of your database. This 24 Hours of PASS session will illustrate the impact of database design on query performance and why thinking about performance during design time will help your database avoid an H.G. Wellsian future. Come learn a little database design, how to read an execution plan, and some unintended consequences of less-than-optimal design decisions.
