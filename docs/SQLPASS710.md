## Speaker(s): David Smith
## Title: In-database analytics with R and SQL Server 2016
## Description:
### With Microsoft SQL Server 2016, data scientists can run in-database analytics using R. This is a “best of both worlds” scenario: delegate database management to SQL Server whilst you create analytics and visualisations in R and Power BI.   In this session, we will cover the overall architecture of SQL R Services and go over some best practices. We will look at best practices in analytics and visualisations with a focus on R, and then we delve more in-depth into some practical common use-cases such as:
-	How to build and store and retrieve an R analytics model and use it to score new data
-	How to use R to produce data visualizations and manage them for retrieval by SQL Reporting Services and Power BI
-	Examples of everyday, practical data-wrangling operations where R can outshine SQL
-	Using Microsoft R’s RevoScaleR package to scale analytics on very large datasets

Goals
By the end of this one-day session, attendees with gain:
•	A basic understanding of the purpose and use of the R programming language
•	How to build predictive models with large data sets using the “RevoScaleR” package in Microsoft R
•	How to build and store and retrieve an R analytics model and evaluate your model
•	How to use R to produce data visualizations and manage them for retrieval by SQL Reporting Services
