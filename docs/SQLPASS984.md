### DevOps processes encompass both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Continuous integration is based around automated builds and tests. Continuous Delivery allows both application developers, database developers and DBAs alike to deploy better quality code/software. In this DEMO heavy session, we will start off with source code only.

Over the course of 59 minutes we will build a deployment pipeline that starts off with pushing our database and application code to source control. We will utilize Visual Studio Team Services to automate our build and tests and perform Continuous Integration operations. The output of these operations will be a standardized package of our built solution.

Utilizing PowerShell in the form of Infrastructure as Code, we will spin up multiple Azure based environments that will be deployed to using automated Continuous Delivery processes.
The finished result will be an automated and reliable deployment pipeline that was built under 59 minutes.

# Storytelling for Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics
#### [Back to calendar](#id-984)
Event Date: 07-02-2019 18:40 - Category: Breakout Session (75 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Jen Underwood
## Title: Storytelling for Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics
## Description:
### Storytelling and depiction of information has existed for hundreds of years in various forms and formats. In today’s era of artificial intelligence and machine-assisted analytics, accurately interpreting and effectively communicating findings is becoming a crucial skill to bridge the growing data literacy gap. To help decision makers get the most value from analytics projects to drive better outcomes, you need to help them make sense of the results. 

Machine learning and advanced analytics can be difficult to understand and explain. Describing the problem, the model, the relationships among variables and the findings are often subtle, surprising and technically complex. Effectively translating quantitative insights and telling a compelling story requires planning, compelling design, and visualization choices. Successful analytical communicators don’t wait until the end of the analysis but rather use the entire process as a vehicle to communicate with stakeholders. Please join me in this session to learn the essence of storytelling for advanced analytics.

# Principle of Least Privilege: The Key to Strong Security
#### [Back to calendar](#id-984)
Event Date: 07-02-2019 18:40 - Category: Breakout Session (75 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Principle of Least Privilege: The Key to Strong Security
## Description:
### A truly strong security model starts with no permissions and adds what is necessary to allow the user or application to do their assigned task - no more, no less. This is called the Principle of Least Privilege. It's a simple concept, but it can be quite difficult to implement in practice, especially if the prevailing practice has been much more permissive.

In this session, we'll talk about the Principle of Least Privilege in more detail, and we'll discuss ways to implement it for the three primary classes of users - general users, applications, and administrators. Each has their own set of needs that requires a separate approach to allowing the security to meet those needs. You'll leave with actionable ideas on ways that you can improve your company's security while minimizing the impact of the changes.

# Getting Better Query Plans by Improving SQL’s Estimates
#### [Back to calendar](#id-984)
Event Date: 07-02-2019 18:40 - Category: Breakout Session (75 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: Getting Better Query Plans by Improving SQL’s Estimates
## Description:
### You’ve been writing T-SQL queries for a few years now, and when you have performance issues, you’ve been updating stats and using OPTION (RECOMPILE). It’s served you well, but every now and then, you hit a problem you can’t solve. Your data’s been growing larger, your queries are taking longer to run, and you’re starting to wonder: how can I start getting better query plans?

The secret is often comparing the query plan’s estimated number of rows to actual number of rows. If they’re different, it’s up to you – not the SQL Server engine – to figure out why the guesses are wrong. To improve ’em, you can change your T-SQL, the way the data’s structured and stored, or how SQL Server thinks about the data.

This session won’t fix every query – but it’ll give you a starting point to understand what you’re looking at, and where to go next as you learn about the Cardinality Estimator.
