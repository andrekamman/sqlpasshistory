## Speaker(s): Jim Wooley
## Title: Entity Framework Performance Monitoring and Tuning
## Description:
### Object Relational Mapping technologies, including the Entity Framework can drastically simplify the programming model against databases, but when done carelessly, performance can suffer. In this session, we'll explore some real-life strategies that have solved performance issues in production applications that I have encountered at a variety of customers. We'll discuss the pros and cons of working without stored procs and cover strategies for monitoring and tuning your entity queries.

## Speaker(s): Thomas Liddle
## Title: Getting Started locally with SQL Server and Kubernetes
## Description:
### Kubernetes is becoming a go-to platform for companies as they explore the realm of containers and microservices.  Kubernetes has proven itself in the web application stack but what about databases?  Microsoft has invested a considerable amount of effort into containerizing Microsoft SQL Server starting with SQL Server 2017.  However, the documentation provided involves running SQL Server in a docker container...what about Kubernetes?

This session involves installing, connecting and working with a local (on your laptop or desktop) Microsoft SQL Server Express instance on Kubernetes.  The goal is to show an administrator or developer how to get started with Microsoft SQL Server locally using components like minikube, Kubernetes, Helm and SSMS. We will explain each component used in the setup, how to install them and finally connect SSMS to our Microsoft SQL Server instance on a local Kubernetes installation.

## Title: Lets go deep in SQL Server Unit Testing with Visual Studio
## Description:
### Everyone that has been involved in the Database Development can notice how huge the impact of a bug can be, especially when these kinds of mistakes could be easily avoided through the Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.

When you start to google search about how to start implementing Unit Testing for SQL Server you always find tSQLt as the first result returned, however, the extremely low number of downloads tell us about the issue with this implementation. Some possible causes could be explained, such as the lack of a free UI tool for executing the tests, but I have been working with many full-stack developers and one of the most important complaints is related to the fact that AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) is not native and they canâ€™t feel a soft transition in their regular tasks for Unit Testing with Databases.

In this presentation, I would like to focus on how to get a better performance through the SQL Unit Test feature of Visual Studio, how to overcome the problems.
