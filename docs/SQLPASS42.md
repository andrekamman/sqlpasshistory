## Title: The Complete Primer to SQL Server Virtualization
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

Your SQL Servers are mostly virtualized at this point, but have you lost the control you used to have over the infrastructure when they were physical servers? Do your SQL Servers “feel” slower now that they are virtualized? When architected and managed with SQL Server in mind, this added layer can help to improve the SQL Server’s availability and ability to change with the business, but only when executed properly.

This all-day, interactive, and hypervisor-agnostic pre-conference session is designed to help data professionals learn more about virtualization and infrastructure. Discover how this new layer can be used to improve the management, availability, and performance of your databases. You will be exposed to all layers of virtualization underneath the SQL Server, from storage to hypervisor. Discover many useful tips and tricks to tuning the database layer to boost performance and availability. This session addresses these topics:
* Virtualization and infrastructure fundamentals
* The SQL Server virtual machine (VM)
* Networking, support, and licensing
* High availability and disaster recovery
* Performance investigation and tuning of the entire stack

## Title: Building Better SSIS Packages
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

Building packages in SQL Server Integration Services is easy. Building good packages takes a bit more effort.

SQL Server Integration Services is deceptively easy to use. With a few hours of instruction or self-study, most data professionals can throw together an SSIS package. However, creating a process that simply runs successfully isn’t the endgame; enterprise-class ETL demands a higher standard. Specifically, well-designed packages will be:
•	Reliable
•	Resilient
•	Reusable
•	Maintainable
•	Well performing
There’s nothing magical about building rock-solid SSIS packages, but it does take some discipline, experience, and a library of best practices. That is exactly the aim of this course: to demonstrate a set of proven practices that help frame the development of enterprise-ready SSIS packages.
In this full-day presentation, we will walk through each of these five facets of well-built packages, discussing and then demonstrating ways of applying these practices to design better SSIS packages. Among the topics for the day:
•	Checking for problems even when the package executes successfully
•	Building effective tests for your packages
•	Error handling and prevention
•	Being kind to your fellow developers by building  clear and easy-to-maintain packages
•	Leave a trail of evidence: package logging done properly
•	Avoiding performance bottlenecks: tips for making packages run faster
•	Using the right tool for the job by integrating non-SSIS tools when appropriate

## Title: Advanced SQL Server Availability Architectures and Deployments
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

Most people are familiar with simple availability solutions that protect their instances or databases by using SQL Server failover clustering instances (FCIs) and availability groups (AGs). However, deploying advanced architectures and solutions that span multiple subnets, datacenters, and even the cloud requires a lot of knowledge and planning that is not easily revealed through a simple web search. Understanding the building blocks for advanced networking,  storage, and Windows concepts and how SQL Server fits into them all is the only way to be successful.

Covered topics, which apply to multiple versions of SQL Server and Windows,  include: 
- Multi-subnet FCI and AG architectures that span multiple datacenters and the cloud
- Advanced cluster quorum for complex architectures
- Network and storage design for advanced SQL Server availability solutions

Attendees get hands-on experience via labs, using their own laptops to reinforce advanced concepts such as forcing quorum and bringing an AG online after failing an AG over to a non-preferred replica. Laptop requirements will be sent a few weeks before the session.

This advanced session is not for beginners. The basics of SQL Server availability are covered, but prior knowledge of clustering, FCIs, and AGs is assumed.

## Title:  Finding Your Balance: BI in the Cloud, On Premises, or Both
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

Have you heard about Power BI and Microsoft Azure? These services can take many forms, such as cloud virtual machines (VMs), database as a service (DBaaS), Power BI in the cloud, and a myriad of other services. In this full-day pre-conference session, you learn about building business intelligence (BI) solutions using Microsoft Azure, Power BI, and the Microsoft BI stack (on premises, in the cloud, or both). This session gives you a foundation for determining when incorporating cloud components into your BI solution makes sense and how to get started. 

In this full-day workshop, you learn:
• How to use Azure components to build a BI infrastructure completely or partially in the cloud
• Which changes to your solution architecture are necessary when you move components to the cloud
• Best practices for configuring and networking Azure resources
• How to integrate your cloud-based solution with your on-premises Active Directory
• How to securely connect Power BI to your Azure and on-premises data sources
• How to configure supported data sources for scheduled refresh
• Best practices for administering Power BI components in Office 365

## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Index Internals: RowStore, ColumnStore, and NoStore!
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

Indexes allow SQL Server to access your data in the most efficient manner. Indexes are the only tuning technique that can improve query performance by orders of magnitude. Understanding exactly how your indexes are structured can enable you to choose the best indexes for your queries. SQL Server 2014 provides three very different kinds of index structures: traditional B-tree clustered and nonclustered indexes, ColumnStore clustered and nonclustered indexes, and in-memory indexes that are used for memory-optimized tables. 

In this session, we look at how each of these three types of indexes is stored and used. For B-tree indexes, we look at the difference between clustered and nonclustered indexes, and we explore fragmentation and defragmentation. For ColumnStore indexes, we see how they are stored differently than B-tree row-based indexes, and we compare SQL Server 2012 nonclustered indexes with SQL Server 2014 clustered ColumnStores. For in-memory online transaction processing (OLTP) indexes, we see yet another way of managing indexes. Because indexes for memory-optimized tables are not stored on disk (hence the NoStore reference), we talk about how they can be persisted across SQL Server restarts. For each type, we also cover some best practice recommendations. 

Knowing how indexes are useful and how each type is stored and managed can enable you to compare them and to decide which index type is the best choice for your needs.

## Speaker(s): Paul Randal
## Title: Performance Troubleshooting Using Waits and Latches
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

One of the first things to check when investigating performance issues are wait and latch statistics, which can often point you in the right direction for further analysis. Unfortunately, many people misinterpret what SQL Server tells them and jump to conclusions about how to solve a problem: what we often call "knee-jerk performance tuning". In this full-day pre-conference workshop, you learn how to investigate and interpret wait and latch statistics; you get practical techniques you can take home and start using immediately. You also learn what a myriad of wait and latch types actually mean and how to investigate lightly documented types to gain insight into what causes them. Don't waste time when it comes to performance troubleshooting. Wait statistics are the fastest route to understanding your problems, and this workshop will help you get there faster.

Most of the time, SQL Server returns data quickly. But sometimes, performance is slow, and what SQL Server did to access your data just doesn’t make sense. Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is a declarative language that details what data you need, but without information about how SQL Server should get it. Join order, predicate analysis--how does SQL Server decide the order or when to evaluate a predicate? There are numerous reasons why query performance can suffer.

This full-day pre-conference session covers a number of critical areas. For each area, the session shows you behavior, execution plan, troubleshooting technique, and most importantly, possible solutions. 
 
This workshop is about solving your query-performance problems. You’ll walk away with a plethora of strategies to troubleshoot and tackle even the most difficult query problems. Stop using "sledgehammer" approaches (updating statistics, rebuilding indexes, clearing cache) and learn more finessed ways to solve query plan quality problems.

Topics include understanding and maintaining statistics, managing very large tables (VLTs), skewed data, and distribution problems; troubleshooting common and advanced scenarios; and using the cardinality estimation models (and trace flags) available in SQL Server 2008 through 2014.

## Title: The Enterprise Scripting Workshop
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

The database administrator (DBA) life can be frustrating: You rarely have time to innovate because the same tasks fill up your time day after day. Your users are unhappy about how long it takes to resolve “simple” tickets. You need to put big items on hold to manage special requests. As careful as you are, mistakes creep in the busier you get.

In this pre-conference workshop, learn how to develop enterprise scripts with a huge range of uses. A good set of reusable scripts can reduce task time from hours or days to just a few minutes, and eliminate mistakes from your environment.
• Enterprise philosophy: Tackle simple tasks with the whole environment in mind.
• Single data store: Define the benefits and uses of a single central database for common-use data and metadata.
• Choice of tools: Choose the best tool (e.g., PowerShell, T-SQL, SSIS) for the job.
• Environment ground work: Prepare your environment for enterprise scripting.
• Real-world scripts: Work through dozens of enterprise scripting issues (e.g., alerting, error handling, multiple SQL versions) as you develop a real enterprise script in class 

This session is for DBAs with a basic understanding of PowerShell. It’s for anyone who touches backups or security, maintains databases, troubleshoots performance, monitors disk space, or any of a hundred other DBA tasks. Enterprise scripting is for anyone who has more tasks than time.

## Speaker(s): Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: SQL Server Internals: The Practical Angle
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

A deep understanding of SQL Server internals makes it much easier to design and maintain efficient SQL Server solutions. Unfortunately, database professionals who lack this knowledge often make design and implementation decisions that adversely affect their systems.

This pre-conference session helps to address these issues and shows you how SQL Server components work under the hood, work together and communicate with one another, and most importantly, affect your systems. 

The session is for database administrators (DBAs) and developers who want to design, develop, and maintain systems to get the most from SQL Server. The session can also help database pros who prefer to understand and fix the root cause of a problem rather than simply applying a bandage. The session is based on the book “Pro SQL Server Internals” (http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430259620), includes numerous demos, and discusses answers to the following questions:
- How does SQL Server store data and use indexes, and how can you efficiently design and maintain them?
- What is the internal implementation of the various database objects, and when should they be used or not be used?
- How do you troubleshoot and fix concurrency issues and design efficient transaction strategies?
- How does SQL Server execute queries, and how are the most common plan-caching-related issues addressed?
- How do you quickly identify and resolve issues and bottlenecks in systems?

## Speaker(s): Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: Thinking Outside the In-Memory Box
## Description:
### Even though in-memory OLTP can significantly improve performance of OLTP systems, it comes with an extensive set of limitations that often make refactoring of existing systems cost-ineffective and prevents widespread adoption of the technology. However, in-memory OLTP can be beneficial in other common use cases besides replacing on-disk with memory-optimized tables. 

This session discusses several of these use-cases:  
* Improving performance of ETL processes with memory-optimized tables
* Using the in-memory OLTP engine as a replacement for the distributed cache and session state server
* Using natively compiled procedures to optimize imperative code and calculations
* Enhancing performance of batch import operations with memory-optimized TVPs

Finally, this session shows several techniques that help address in-memory OLTP limitations by utilizing horizontal and vertical partitioning and combining the data from on-disk and memory-optimized tables.

## Speaker(s): Brandon Leach
## Title: Bringing Balance to the SQL Server Force with Resource Governor
## Description:
### Balancing the needs of different groups of users on your servers isn't always easy. Competing workloads and business priorities can present a challenging problem to DBAs. Between maintenance, operational, and reporting queries, you can find yourself rather constrained in terms of performance.

Resource Governor is one the most underused features available to enterprise edition users of SQL Server. In this session, we delve into the basics of the Resource Governor feature in SQL Server and when, why, and how you should use it. We look at the types of issues this feature can help resolve. We delve into various components of the feature, such as a classifier function, workload groups, and resource pools and how those components change the behavior of SQL Server. We bring all this together with a sample implementation. Along the way, we look at best practices and questions to answer to ensure a successful implementation.

## Speaker(s): Mladen Prajdić
## Title: Visualizing Streaming Data in Real Time
## Description:
### We're all familiar with reports or dashboards that show a static snapshot of data and must be refreshed on an interval. Those are important visualizations, but sometimes you need a real time view of your data streams--and snapshots aren't enough.

What if you could monitor multiple servers with SQL Trace or Extended Events or had some other source of streaming data and could see it all happening live on a central monitoring website?

In this session, we'll take a detailed look at this scenario and build a system for such monitoring. We'll use the Extended Events .Net provider to get the live data stream, SignalR to get the live stream from the server to the website, and the D3 JavaScript library for actual real-time visualizations on any device.

After seeing all this in action, you'll definitely get a few ideas on where you can use this approach in your company.

## Title: Turbo Boost Performance: In-Memory Tables and Index Optimizations
## Description:
### With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, many of us expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries that use in-memory tables actually start to perform the same or even worse than their equivalent disk-based table predecessors? In this session, we look at in-memory tables and their best use cases. We also explore the changes to the indexing design for in-memory-based objects and how it differs from existing disk-based table indexing. Also, we cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory objects, to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.

## Title: Integrating SQL Server Analysis Services with Hadoop
## Description:
### Although Hadoop is designed for scalability with massive amounts of data, it is inherently slow. This makes ad hoc analysis prohibitive because of slow query performance. To address this issue, you can bring Hadoop data into SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). This session looks at how to integrate SQL SSAS with Hadoop to provide real-time data analysis and reporting. You learn about the Hadoop ecosystem and architecture, how to integrate Hadoop with SSAS, and how to take advantage of the Hadoop-SSAS combination to provide a data analysis platform for your business.

## Speaker(s): Rafael Salas
## Title: Solving the Data Integration Problem with Power Query
## Description:
### Self-service business intelligence (BI) technologies have gained popularity in the past few years. They often highlight how easy data exploration and fancy data visualizations are, but leave out the most expensive and time-consuming part of the process: preparing and integrating the data. Why? Perhaps because most self-service technologies fall short when pulling together information that is drawn from multiple systems.

In this session, learn how  businesses and IT can use Power Query--a free data integration tool and part of Power BI--to transform, combine, and share data from heterogeneous data sources, reducing the time and cost to prepare the data that is used to produce analysis and reports. We also discuss how Power Query fits in the larger BI landscape and the considerations and concerns that IT stakeholders have when adopting this type of self-service technology.

## Title: Create and Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour
## Description:
### Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) automates your BI patterns and eliminates the manual repetition that consumes most of your SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) development time. This one-hour  presentation uses the free BIDSHelper add-in for BIDS and SSDT to introduce Biml and to automatically generate large quantities of custom SSIS packages. The session is largely demo-driven, and reusable sample code is distributed for you to use in your own projects.

Using a live-typing approach, we start from scratch and by the end of the session, we create a full-blown staging environment. This includes the creation of hundreds of target table creation scripts, data load packages, data scrubbing rules, logging, and more. The best part is that you can freely reuse the code in your own environment simply by changing the connection strings, or you can make small changes to implement your own data load patterns.

## Title: Statistics and Query Plans
## Description:
### If you want to tune queries, you have to look at query plans and you have to understand what they’re showing you.  One thing people look for when tuning is “bad cardinality estimates”.  If you’ve wondered what that means, and you want to understand how the optimizer uses statistics when creating a query plan, then join me for this session on statistics and query plans.  We’ll set the stage with a review of what statistics are, then see how the optimizer uses them and where to find that “cardinality estimate” information in a plan.  We’ll also cover the various ways statistics can be updated, explore what happens to plans when those updates occur, and ultimately you will see why understanding how it all works is critical when you’re troubleshooting performance issues.  Expect lots of demos so you can truly understand what statistics are, how they're used, and why their management is so essential for good performance.

## Speaker(s): Edward Pollack
## Title: My Favorite DMVs
## Description:
### Monitoring and optimizing performance on a production SQL server can seem like an overwhelming task.  Many areas require attention, such as resource utilization, query execution, performance, indexing, and more.

Dynamic management views (DMVs) are a direct peek into the internal working of your database server. With them, mysteries can quickly be unraveled when trouble brews or even be prevented, through monitoring solutions that keep an eye on these views all the time.

Using queries that have been personally run and deployed in production environments, we explore what these views are used for, how to effectively use them, and the many problems that can be solved with them.

With these tools at your disposal, the slow-running query has nowhere to hide, missing indexes become plain as day, and resource pressure is easy to monitor and respond to.  Now you can focus on all the other important things vying for your attention on a daily basis!

## Speaker(s): Rod Colledge
## Title: Building Hybrid BI Solutions with Power BI
## Description:
### Traditional business intelligence (BI) solutions are geared towards the occasional user who consumes reports that are built to answer predefined questions, using data controlled by the IT department. What about business users that have questions that have yet to be defined or understood, or that require a combination of data sources--some outside the IT department?

In this session, take a look at building non-traditional BI solutions by taking a hybrid approach with Power BI. 

Discover how you can empower business users with self-service tools, in a way that doesn't compromise data security or governance. See how you can combine on-premise and Internet data sources with cloud-based BI services. Look at the Corporate Data Catalog to enable secure data discovery. And explore the Microsoft Data Management Gateway, which enables secure data-refresh scenarios for cloud-based BI solutions.

# The Plan Cache Whisperer: Performance Tuning SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#id-42)
Event Date: 29-10-2015 10:15 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Jason Strate
## Title: The Plan Cache Whisperer: Performance Tuning SQL Server
## Description:
### Execution plans tell SQL Server how to execute queries. If you listen closely, execution plans can also tell you when performance-tuning opportunities exist in your environment.  By listening to your queries, you can understand how SQL Server is operating and gain insight into how your environment is functioning. In this session, learn how to use XQuery to browse and search the plan cache, enabling you to find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries.  In addition, learn how a performance issue on a single execution plan can be used to find similar issues on other execution plans, enabling you to scale up your performance tuning effectiveness. You can use this information to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using which indexes. All this and more is readily available through the plan cache.

## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: Statistics for the New Data Pro
## Description:
### Many performance tuning methods can get your queries to run faster. But the most important thing you can do to improve query performance is to ensure that you have provided the query optimizer within SQL Server with the best possible statistics. This session teaches you what statistics are, how they are generated, and their use within the optimizer. You can take home a better understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics, to write better T-SQL and build better database structures to avoid common issues such as bad parameter sniffing. Help the optimizer help you by maintaining your statistics and get improved query performance.

## Speaker(s): Allen White
## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
## Description:
### Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring it to a single destination. Creating individual packages can be tedious, and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again. BI Markup Language (Biml) makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating Biml scripts easy. This session shows you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages that perform similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.

## Title: Analyzing Audience Reaction to the PASS Summit Keynote
## Description:
### If you've been to PASS Summit before, you know that social media channels such as Twitter go wild during the keynote speeches. Many people comment on what's being said: Some comments are positive, some ... not so positive. How can you make sense of it all? Which announcements did attendees like and which ones didn't they like? When were the attendees engaged and when were they bored? Who are the thought-leaders in the SQL Server community? Do database administrators (DBAs) behave differently that business intelligence (BI) pros?

In this session, you'll see how a variety of Microsoft tools can be used to analyze this activity:
* Use Bing Pulse to capture real-time audience feedback during the keynote.
* Use Power BI to analyze data from Bing Pulse, Twitter, and other social media sources.
* Use NodeXL to perform network analysis on Twitter data.
* Use Azure Machine Learning (ML) to perform sentiment analysis.

## Title: SQL Server Mystery: Dead Reports Don't Talk
## Description:
### Sabotage? Before a pivotal meeting to secure venture capital, a key report vanishes from the server without a trace, leaving Cromulent Technologies' future in jeopardy. With a combination of teamwork, SQL Server knowledge, and sleuthing, you must solve the crime and save Cromulent Technologies! 

This session is part interactive mystery, part technical presentation in which attendees work together in small groups to discuss suspect interviews and clues, attempting to solve a SQL Server crime. We will focus on SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) administration, including: 
* Understanding how SSRS content is stored and retrieved
* Caching and snapshots for improved performance
* When you need (or don't need) an encryption key
* Backup and restore strategies for ReportServer and ReportServerTempDB

If you're a database administrator (DBA) or developer who wants to learn key SSRS administration concepts while exercising your mystery-solving skills, this session is for you!

## Title: APS and SSAS for Real-Time Analysis
## Description:
### Microsoft Analytic Platform System (APS) can easily scale to petabytes of data. Consider the business value if all that data was available to end users in a SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) cube or model that was always up to date. APS can quickly process huge data sets that previously took hours, enabling more up-to-date reporting. By leveraging the processing power of APS and real-time modes in SSAS tabular or multidimensional, business decisions can be made faster than ever. 

Learn APS best practices such as choosing the right distribution key for tables, laying out the data model for optimal data movement and taking advantage of APS features such as the clustered columnstore index to get the best possible performance from SSAS cubes. This functionality is not without its limitations. Come see how to work around those limitations and optimize SSAS models to work with APS.

## Description:
### Although Availability Groups are relatively easy to implement, there are many complexities when it comes to administering and optimizing them--especially if you are familiar with Failover Clustering. In some cases, your existing database solutions perform slower. In this session, we examine the various potential problems you can have when implementing Availability Groups and the potential solutions to these problems. This session covers areas such as performance, administration, and security management. You learn how to manage complex jobs, backup strategies, and logins within an Availability Group environment. You also learn how Availability Groups might dramatically affect your application performance, how to recognise such performance problems, and how to resolve them. With a number of real-world examples, this practical session enables you to maximize the benefits of Availability Groups.

## Speaker(s): Richie Rump
## Title: Who's Afraid of Entity Framework?
## Description:
### Do any applications in your environment use SQL written not by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are it is using the Microsoft Entity Framework (EF).

EF and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is EF a technology that developers should even be using? This session reviews what EF is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how it works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by EF Finally, we'll review EF-generated T-SQL and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional who manages databases that are accessed through EF or want a basic knowledge of how EF works, this session is for you.

## Speaker(s): J May, Brian Walters
## Title: SQL Server on Flash: Re-Thinking Best Practices
## Description:
### Flash storage is a game changer for virtually every app in which it is used.  Whether used locally, for tiered storage, or all-flash arrays, flash is turning what we thought we knew about SQL Server best practices on its head.  In this vendor-agnostic presentation, learn how contemporary IT environments are incorporating flash as an integral & vital part of their architecture—bare metal or virtualized. Standardizing on in-server flash is vital for optimizing performance, scalability, costs, reliability, & availability.  In this session we'll review fundamental I/O concepts, SQL Server use cases & implementation details for flash, & dispel myths.  We'll also demo flash & learn how flash flips the /faster bit & the significant impact flash makes not just in terms of performance, but also best practices.  Lastly, we'll document the massive savings in licensing driven by consolidation on flash, savings so substantial that flash often pays for itself.

## Speaker(s): Allen White
## Title: Scalable Application Design with Service Broker
## Description:
### How your business applications interact directly with the corporate database can dramatically affect how successful you are. One of the biggest issues is performance with large databases. By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates, you can focus performance concerns  where the timeliness is critical. SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently and minimizes conflicts with your critical updates. This session walks you through the steps to get Service Broker running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.

### With their in-memory capabilities and state-of-the-art data compression algorithms, tabular models are an automatic choice for many customers. Many models end up being 50 GB or less, achieving compression of 10x to 100x the database size. But if you ask industry experts what would be a safe size range for a tabular model performance wise, the most common answer would be "It depends." In this session, we try to find the answer. Watch and learn all the processes and rationale behind building a huge tabular model, starting from size estimations and hardware selections. Contemplate design decisions (especially  multidimensional versus tabular) and off-the-road architecture while trying to balance processing and query performance. Watch for performance optimizations and development tips and tricks that you definitely do not want to miss, while working on the tabular model. Above all, see the performance statistics for yourself!

## Title: Hacking the SSIS Catalog
## Description:
### The SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Catalog supports enterprise data integration by providing execution, logging, parameter management, and reporting. But what if your enterprise needs more functionality than the SSIS Catalog provides? Should you build your own SSIS Framework? In this session, learn: 
- A non-invasive way to integrate a custom enterprise data integration framework into the SSIS Catalog
- Methods to identify and overcome limitations of the SSIS Catalog
- Where and how the SSIS Catalog stores metadata and logging

## Title: Building a Scalable Analytical Solution Using IaaS and Elasticsearch
## Description:
### Come to this session to see how to build a scalable analytical solution on Microsoft Azure IaaS with Elasticsearch and Kibana. Infrastructure is one of the foundations of cloud computing. Being able to lift and shift your on-premise architecture and drop it into the cloud opens up a world of opportunities.  Elasticsearch is a distributed restful search and analytics application. It is document oriented, schema free, and based on the Lucene search engine. Not content with being a free text search engine, Elasticsearch lets you perform real-time analytics over your data as well.

Kibana is a visualisation tool that works seamlessly with Elasticsearch.  It allows you to create time-based comparisons over your data and gives the users power to derive insight from the data. It has many visualisations available, and this session shows you the right ones to use for the situation.

## Speaker(s): Chris Webb
## Title: Using Power Query to Build a Reporting Solution in Excel
## Description:
### Power Query is a desktop extract-transform-load (ETL) tool, but it's also a lot more. You can use Power Query to build an impressive Excel-based reporting solution, similar to what you can achieve with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). Use this solution for scenarios in which end users want to see tables that contain a large amount of detail-level data rather than aggregated data in pivot tables. In this session, learn how to:
* Connect to multiple data sources and combine data from them in Power Query
* Create parameterized queries in Power Query and pass parameters to them from your Excel worksheet, so that users can load only the data they need
* Build an SSRS-like user interface for your reports in Excel
* Get the best possible performance in Power Query, using query folding
* Learn about the pros and cons of loading data to the Excel Data Model or Power Pivot and using Excel tables
* Use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) queries to query data in the Excel Data Model or Power Pivot
* Refresh data with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)

In this demo-based session, we give you a complete overview into a customer project during which we used SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), SSRS, and Master Data Services (MDS) to do exactly that:
- Import statistical data with R and SSIS
- Assemble report parts to get complete reports with almost 100 pages
- Define themes for different corporate designs
- Define languages for different reports
- Render the reports with different rendering extensions
- Develop Office add-ins to automate SSIS, SSRS, and MDS

## Title: Date Dimension: Past and Future in One Script
## Description:
### All data warehouses need a date and time dimension to enable proper analysis across time. Most data warehouse designers use one that is provided by tools or create one in Excel. But what if you need to set up custom holidays or want different calendars, such as Fiscal or Julian? You can have any date and time dimension you need by using a single SQL script that can be modified and rerun as necessary. Learn what it takes to design a date and time dimension that does all the calculations and formatting up front so that reports are easier to create. A sample script is provided; it creates the date and time dimensions and can be reused as often as necessary without breaking your data warehouse--and it takes only seconds to run!

## Title: Analyzing your ETL Solution with PowerShell
## Description:
### Some ETL solutions have built-in mapping so that you can easily find the parts that need to change when you want to change something in the sources or destinations. Unfortunately, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) does not have this functionality, so finding which package uses which columns in your databases and source files is not always easy. Fortunately, PowerShell can do this task for you. This session shows you how to analyze a few hundred SSIS packages and even make changes, if needed. After this session, you will know how to more easily estimate how much work proposed changes to your sources or destinations require in your ETL solution.

## Description:
### Got tables with millions or billions of rows but can't truncate or archive to reduce their sizes? CIO/CFO mandates DBAs to leverage the "cheap, "elastic compute/storage capacity" and "infinite scale" capabilities of the cloud after reading the glossy brochures? Users want all data, including cold/archive data always online because they don't know when they'll need it? 

What if you can stretch an existing SQL Server table to Azure little or no application changes? Data is moved securely and transparently. Standard TSQL queries continue to work as-is regardless of where the data is stored. Backup/restore just hot data while cold/archive data is automatically protected. Re-index only the few million rows of hot data though the table has billions of rows in total. 

All this while DBAs retains full control from the on-prem SQL Server even if advanced security features such as row level security or encryption is employed. Come learn how you can with Stretch Database.

## Speaker(s): Dan Bulos
## Title: Dashboard Design for Maximum Impact
## Description:
### How can you design a useful and appealing dashboard? While choosing key performance indicators (KPIs), charts, and tables are important, a dashboard is more than just an onscreen collection of charts and tables. To paraphrase Stephen Few, a dashboard should display the most important information to achieve objectives that can be monitored at a glance.  

The first task is choosing a dashboard type and purpose. This session reviews a framework to determine the theme and content of a dashboard. We look at common graphical content and how to use tables in a dashboard. We also examine table-specific content such as microcharts, icons, and exception highlighting.  

Dashboard layout and flow is not covered in the literature about dashboards but is important.  Which content should be adjacent on the dashboard? How do you arrange content that should be scanned in a particular order? We review how to arrange dashboard content and set up appropriate navigation.

## Speaker(s): Argenis Fernandez
## Title: Zero-Downtime Upgrades: Rockstar DBA
## Description:
### SQL Server upgrades bring enticing new features and much needed enhancements, but can you perform them while maintaining high availability of your SQL Server infrastructure? 

You can actually do this by leveraging rolling upgrades, which are upgrades performed with minimal downtime or service disruptions.

In this session you will: 
* Understand how rolling upgrades are better than in place upgrades 
* Learn how to use database mirroring or AlwaysOn Availability Groups for rolling upgrades 
* Explore how you might use Log Shipping to perform a simpler type of rolling upgrade 

This is a demo-intensive session, so you can see rolling upgrades live and up close. 

If you are considering upgrading to a major version of SQL Server, or just applying a Service Pack or a Cumulative Update, this session is for you!

# Testing SSIS Packages

Event Date: 30-10-2015 14:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Tim Mitchell
## Title: Testing SSIS Packages
## Description:
### Senior developer: “How do you test your code?” Junior developer: “I compile it.” It’s an old joke, but too often this reflects the reality of testing. If the code compiles, it has passed its test. Sadly, this principle is sometimes applied to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as well: “When the SSIS package runs without error, testing is complete.” 

As in software development, testing of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages should not end at when the package executes successfully. You must also confirm that the package does what it was intended to do without placing an undue performance burden on the system.

This session walks through design patterns for testing SSIS packages during and after the development process. The session covers topics such as these:
* Performance testing
* Patterns for validating execution results at runtime
* Validating package metadata before execution
* Design time versus runtime testing
* Making a graceful exit: testing for error handling

## Title: How to Build a Virtual Test Lab for SQL Server
## Description:
### You’ve learned a lot of new techniques and concepts at the conference, and you’re excited to go home and try them out. Now what? Most of us don’t have spare servers lying around or test labs in the office that we can use to try new ideas safely, without disrupting others’ work. Virtualization provides a practical solution to this problem--and it doesn’t need to cost a lot. In this session, learn how to find the tools you need to create your own virtual test environment for SQL Server on hardware you have lying around, and discover that larger test labs for your office do not need to break the bank.

## Title: Visualizing Geographic and Geometric Data
## Description:
### This session explores ways to present geographic and geometric data using Microsoft visualization tools, including Excel, Power BI, and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). From providing geographic analytics to diagramming locations on a warehouse floor plan, these visualization tools can be used in a variety of ways to create spatial representations of your data. This session also looks at the use of the SQL Server geographic and geometric data types and possibly a game or two built using geographic and geometric visualizations.

## Title: Goodbye Next Next Next, Hello Automated Installs
## Description:
### Tired of clicking through all those setup screens and entering the same information over and over again? Do something about it: Automate your installs! From base SQL Server installs to service cacks, cumulative updates, and even client tools for DBAs and developers, your installs can be automated by using SQL Server FineBuild (CodePlex Project). Automating your installs doesn't just save you time, it improves standardization and adherence to best practices. There are multiple ways to automate your installs, but FineBuild goes above and beyond by enabling you to automate every part of the install, from file locations to clusters, service accounts to custom databases, SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), Master Data Services (MDS), and configurations and settings, to many common third-party tools and more. This session covers many of the scenarios you might encounter, and you walk away with some pre-built install scripts to help get you started.

# 2014 SSIS Project Deployment Model: Deployment and Maintenance
#### [Back to calendar](#id-42)
Event Date: 30-10-2015 15:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Bill Fellows
## Title: 2014 SSIS Project Deployment Model: Deployment and Maintenance
## Description:
### The 2014 SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Project Deployment Model introduces new opportunities for the delivery of SSIS solutions. Gone are decisions about logging providers, configuration approaches, and deployment targets. Now, you need to focus on the creation of an .ispac, the approaches to deploying the project, and applying configurations to ensure expected behavior.

This session begins by exploring mapping between elements in an SSIS project and their counterparts in the compiled file, the .ispac. The session then covers three approaches for automating the deployment of this unit into SSISDB We then cover the administration side of the SSIS Catalog. You create SSIS environment variables and apply them to configure run-time behaviour. Finally, you work through the native tooling to troubleshoot failed SSIS packages. We'll cover SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) reports, Catalog views, and data taps for run-time collection of values.

Event Date: 30-10-2015 15:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): David Bermingham
## Title: Understanding Windows Azure High Availability Options for SQL Server
## Description:
### Windows Azure provides an excellent IaaS platform for deploying SQL Server. Although Microsoft is managing the infrastructure, you still need to plan for high availability and disaster recovery. In this session, learn how to leverage Azure Fault Domains, Upgrade Domains, and Internal Load Balancers to ensure the high availability of SQL Server deployments within the Azure cloud. 

SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups deployed in Azure have specific requirements that we discuss in detail and illustrate through live demonstrations. Demos include configuration via both PowerShell and the Azure Portal.

Hybrid cloud configurations are also introduced as a disaster recovery solution for SQL Server deployments. On premise-to-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, and intercloud options are demonstrated, and the benefits of each configuration are discussed in detail.
