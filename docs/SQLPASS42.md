## Title: The Complete Primer to SQL Server Virtualization
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

Your SQL Servers are mostly virtualized at this point, but have you lost the control you used to have over the infrastructure when they were physical servers? Do your SQL Servers “feel” slower now that they are virtualized? When architected and managed with SQL Server in mind, this added layer can help to improve the SQL Server’s availability and ability to change with the business, but only when executed properly.

This all-day, interactive, and hypervisor-agnostic pre-conference session is designed to help data professionals learn more about virtualization and infrastructure. Discover how this new layer can be used to improve the management, availability, and performance of your databases. You will be exposed to all layers of virtualization underneath the SQL Server, from storage to hypervisor. Discover many useful tips and tricks to tuning the database layer to boost performance and availability. This session addresses these topics:
* Virtualization and infrastructure fundamentals
* The SQL Server virtual machine (VM)
* Networking, support, and licensing
* High availability and disaster recovery
* Performance investigation and tuning of the entire stack

## Title: Building Better SSIS Packages
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

Building packages in SQL Server Integration Services is easy. Building good packages takes a bit more effort.

SQL Server Integration Services is deceptively easy to use. With a few hours of instruction or self-study, most data professionals can throw together an SSIS package. However, creating a process that simply runs successfully isn’t the endgame; enterprise-class ETL demands a higher standard. Specifically, well-designed packages will be:
•	Reliable
•	Resilient
•	Reusable
•	Maintainable
•	Well performing
There’s nothing magical about building rock-solid SSIS packages, but it does take some discipline, experience, and a library of best practices. That is exactly the aim of this course: to demonstrate a set of proven practices that help frame the development of enterprise-ready SSIS packages.
In this full-day presentation, we will walk through each of these five facets of well-built packages, discussing and then demonstrating ways of applying these practices to design better SSIS packages. Among the topics for the day:
•	Checking for problems even when the package executes successfully
•	Building effective tests for your packages
•	Error handling and prevention
•	Being kind to your fellow developers by building  clear and easy-to-maintain packages
•	Leave a trail of evidence: package logging done properly
•	Avoiding performance bottlenecks: tips for making packages run faster
•	Using the right tool for the job by integrating non-SSIS tools when appropriate

### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

An upgrade and/or migration is far more than just a case of moving a database or installing a new version of SQL Server. This session will guide you through the process, looking at not only the technology but the methodology, processes and tools that we have at our disposal to make a successful move to more current versions on premises, in the cloud, or both with SQL Server in an Azure VM or Azure SQL Database. We will dive deep into workload-specific upgrade needs for OLTP, HA, SSAS/SSRS, and SSIS environments. 

For those impacted by the end of extended support for SQL Server 2005 on 04/12/2016, we will discuss enhancements to the SQL Server platform and examples of how to take advantage of the latest features.

Bacon will be served at 8:00 am sharp so don’t be late.

## Speaker(s): Pinal Dave
## Title: 42 Tips to Performance Tuning, Optimization, and Everything
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

This demo-oriented, full-day pre-conference session answers the questions that database administrators (DBAs) and developers often have about performance tuning and query optimization. Some problems have straightforward answers, but others are often invisible or need attention without even a problem statement. This session is divided into these three major components:
- Identify common patterns and antipatterns for database performance tuning; for example, slow-running queries, I/O-intensive operations, CPU bottlenecks, memory optimizations, tempdb contention, and more
- Resolve optimization hindrances and issues proactively; for example, indexing strategies, file growths, server deployment best practices, statistics, wait stats and queues, and more 
- Avoid query performance surprises when upgraded to the most recent version of SQL Server 2014; for example, new cardinality engine, ColumnStore indexes best practices, live plans, Azure enhancements, in-memory online transaction processing (OLTP) optimizations, and more

We discuss 42 tips, tricks, and scripts in this session. Every attendee will have those scripts handy upon completion of the session.

## Speaker(s): Stacia Varga
## Title: Visualizing Data: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

The Microsoft BI stack provides an assortment of data visualization tools, but do you know how to use these tools effectively to communicate information clearly? 

In this full-day pre-conference workshop, you start by building a foundation of visualization principles and learning about the history and current state of visualization theory. In addition, this session introduces the vocabulary of visualization as you explore four main categories of visualizations: comparison, composition, relationship, and distribution. 

Next, you examine how visualizations can distort your data and how to correct bad or ugly visualizations by correctly selecting the right tool and applying the appropriate design. We examine many examples of data visualizations, identify the problems with those visualizations, learn the principles of good design, and apply those principles to transform the bad and the ugly into good visualizations.  

Last, we survey the visualization landscape within the Microsoft BI toolset. We compare and contrast the options available among these tools. We take a close look at the advantages and disadvantages of each tool so that you have a better understanding of the available options so you can decide which of these tools best support your own visualization requirements.

## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: Advanced SQL Server Availability Architectures and Deployments
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

Most people are familiar with simple availability solutions that protect their instances or databases by using SQL Server failover clustering instances (FCIs) and availability groups (AGs). However, deploying advanced architectures and solutions that span multiple subnets, datacenters, and even the cloud requires a lot of knowledge and planning that is not easily revealed through a simple web search. Understanding the building blocks for advanced networking,  storage, and Windows concepts and how SQL Server fits into them all is the only way to be successful.

Covered topics, which apply to multiple versions of SQL Server and Windows,  include: 
- Multi-subnet FCI and AG architectures that span multiple datacenters and the cloud
- Advanced cluster quorum for complex architectures
- Network and storage design for advanced SQL Server availability solutions

Attendees get hands-on experience via labs, using their own laptops to reinforce advanced concepts such as forcing quorum and bringing an AG online after failing an AG over to a non-preferred replica. Laptop requirements will be sent a few weeks before the session.

This advanced session is not for beginners. The basics of SQL Server availability are covered, but prior knowledge of clustering, FCIs, and AGs is assumed.

This session gives you a foundation for determining when incorporating cloud components into your BI solution makes sense and how to get started. 

In this full-day workshop, you learn:
• How to use Azure components to build a BI infrastructure completely or partially in the cloud
• Which changes to your solution architecture are necessary when you move components to the cloud
• Best practices for configuring and networking Azure resources
• How to integrate your cloud-based solution with your on-premises Active Directory
• How to securely connect Power BI to your Azure and on-premises data sources
• How to configure supported data sources for scheduled refresh
• Best practices for administering Power BI components in Office 365

## Title: Index Internals: RowStore, ColumnStore, and NoStore!
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

Indexes allow SQL Server to access your data in the most efficient manner. Indexes are the only tuning technique that can improve query performance by orders of magnitude. Understanding exactly how your indexes are structured can enable you to choose the best indexes for your queries. SQL Server 2014 provides three very different kinds of index structures: traditional B-tree clustered and nonclustered indexes, ColumnStore clustered and nonclustered indexes, and in-memory indexes that are used for memory-optimized tables. 

In this session, we look at how each of these three types of indexes is stored and used. For B-tree indexes, we look at the difference between clustered and nonclustered indexes, and we explore fragmentation and defragmentation. For ColumnStore indexes, we see how they are stored differently than B-tree row-based indexes, and we compare SQL Server 2012 nonclustered indexes with SQL Server 2014 clustered ColumnStores. For in-memory online transaction processing (OLTP) indexes, we see yet another way of managing indexes. Because indexes for memory-optimized tables are not stored on disk (hence the NoStore reference), we talk about how they can be persisted across SQL Server restarts. For each type, we also cover some best practice recommendations. 

Knowing how indexes are useful and how each type is stored and managed can enable you to compare them and to decide which index type is the best choice for your needs.

## Speaker(s): Paul Randal
## Title: Performance Troubleshooting Using Waits and Latches
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

One of the first things to check when investigating performance issues are wait and latch statistics, which can often point you in the right direction for further analysis. Unfortunately, many people misinterpret what SQL Server tells them and jump to conclusions about how to solve a problem: what we often call "knee-jerk performance tuning". In this full-day pre-conference workshop, you learn how to investigate and interpret wait and latch statistics; you get practical techniques you can take home and start using immediately. You also learn what a myriad of wait and latch types actually mean and how to investigate lightly documented types to gain insight into what causes them. Don't waste time when it comes to performance troubleshooting. Wait statistics are the fastest route to understanding your problems, and this workshop will help you get there faster.

## Title: Queries Gone Wrong: Statistics, Cardinality, Solutions 
## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

Most of the time, SQL Server returns data quickly. But sometimes, performance is slow, and what SQL Server did to access your data just doesn’t make sense. Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is a declarative language that details what data you need, but without information about how SQL Server should get it. Join order, predicate analysis--how does SQL Server decide the order or when to evaluate a predicate? There are numerous reasons why query performance can suffer.

This full-day pre-conference session covers a number of critical areas. For each area, the session shows you behavior, execution plan, troubleshooting technique, and most importantly, possible solutions. 
 
This workshop is about solving your query-performance problems. You’ll walk away with a plethora of strategies to troubleshoot and tackle even the most difficult query problems. Stop using "sledgehammer" approaches (updating statistics, rebuilding indexes, clearing cache) and learn more finessed ways to solve query plan quality problems.

Topics include understanding and maintaining statistics, managing very large tables (VLTs), skewed data, and distribution problems; troubleshooting common and advanced scenarios; and using the cardinality estimation models (and trace flags) available in SQL Server 2008 through 2014.

## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

The database administrator (DBA) life can be frustrating: You rarely have time to innovate because the same tasks fill up your time day after day. Your users are unhappy about how long it takes to resolve “simple” tickets. You need to put big items on hold to manage special requests. As careful as you are, mistakes creep in the busier you get.

In this pre-conference workshop, learn how to develop enterprise scripts with a huge range of uses. A good set of reusable scripts can reduce task time from hours or days to just a few minutes, and eliminate mistakes from your environment.
• Enterprise philosophy: Tackle simple tasks with the whole environment in mind.
• Single data store: Define the benefits and uses of a single central database for common-use data and metadata.
• Choice of tools: Choose the best tool (e.g., PowerShell, T-SQL, SSIS) for the job.
• Environment ground work: Prepare your environment for enterprise scripting.
• Real-world scripts: Work through dozens of enterprise scripting issues (e.g., alerting, error handling, multiple SQL versions) as you develop a real enterprise script in class 

This session is for DBAs with a basic understanding of PowerShell. It’s for anyone who touches backups or security, maintains databases, troubleshoots performance, monitors disk space, or any of a hundred other DBA tasks. Enterprise scripting is for anyone who has more tasks than time.

## Description:
### ** Please note Pre-Conference sessions are available for an additional registration fee of $495 **

A deep understanding of SQL Server internals makes it much easier to design and maintain efficient SQL Server solutions. Unfortunately, database professionals who lack this knowledge often make design and implementation decisions that adversely affect their systems.

This pre-conference session helps to address these issues and shows you how SQL Server components work under the hood, work together and communicate with one another, and most importantly, affect your systems. 

The session is for database administrators (DBAs) and developers who want to design, develop, and maintain systems to get the most from SQL Server. The session can also help database pros who prefer to understand and fix the root cause of a problem rather than simply applying a bandage. The session is based on the book “Pro SQL Server Internals” (http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430259620), includes numerous demos, and discusses answers to the following questions:
- How does SQL Server store data and use indexes, and how can you efficiently design and maintain them?
- What is the internal implementation of the various database objects, and when should they be used or not be used?
- How do you troubleshoot and fix concurrency issues and design efficient transaction strategies?
- How does SQL Server execute queries, and how are the most common plan-caching-related issues addressed?
- How do you quickly identify and resolve issues and bottlenecks in systems?

## Speaker(s): Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: Thinking Outside the In-Memory Box
## Description:
### Even though in-memory OLTP can significantly improve performance of OLTP systems, it comes with an extensive set of limitations that often make refactoring of existing systems cost-ineffective and prevents widespread adoption of the technology. However, in-memory OLTP can be beneficial in other common use cases besides replacing on-disk with memory-optimized tables. 

This session discusses several of these use-cases:  
* Improving performance of ETL processes with memory-optimized tables
* Using the in-memory OLTP engine as a replacement for the distributed cache and session state server
* Using natively compiled procedures to optimize imperative code and calculations
* Enhancing performance of batch import operations with memory-optimized TVPs

Finally, this session shows several techniques that help address in-memory OLTP limitations by utilizing horizontal and vertical partitioning and combining the data from on-disk and memory-optimized tables.

## Title: Dimensional Modeling Design Patterns: Beyond the Basics
## Description:
### Dimensional modeling is one of cornerstones of successful business intelligence (BI) initiatives. Even with new technologies such as PowerPivot and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) tabular models, you need to represent your organization’s data in a way that is accessible for end users and IT staff alike. An effective dimensional model can also help to ensure that your data warehouse or data mart is responsive and can accommodate emerging requirements.

## Speaker(s): Bob Pusateri
## Title: SQL Server Security Basics
## Description:
### The past few years seem to have had more than their fair share of high-profile data breaches, not all of which were caused by sophisticated hacking attempts. This session explains basic methods for securing your SQL Server by making sure you're not leaving the proverbial front door unlocked (or in some cases, wide open). We will discuss the different levels and methods that can be used for granting and restricting rights, as well as the pros and cons of each. You learn steps you can take to design databases with securability in mind from the beginning, so that you can better protect your data later. We also demonstrate scripts that can help audit user rights and make sure logins don't have any more permissions than they need. Security doesn't need to be scary! Attend this session and gain a solid foundation on which to build your DBA career.

## Speaker(s): Mladen Prajdić
## Title: Visualizing Streaming Data in Real Time
## Description:
### We're all familiar with reports or dashboards that show a static snapshot of data and must be refreshed on an interval. Those are important visualizations, but sometimes you need a real time view of your data streams--and snapshots aren't enough.

What if you could monitor multiple servers with SQL Trace or Extended Events or had some other source of streaming data and could see it all happening live on a central monitoring website?

In this session, we'll take a detailed look at this scenario and build a system for such monitoring. We'll use the Extended Events .Net provider to get the live data stream, SignalR to get the live stream from the server to the website, and the D3 JavaScript library for actual real-time visualizations on any device.

After seeing all this in action, you'll definitely get a few ideas on where you can use this approach in your company.

## Speaker(s): Rafael Salas
## Title: Solving the Data Integration Problem with Power Query
## Description:
### Self-service business intelligence (BI) technologies have gained popularity in the past few years. They often highlight how easy data exploration and fancy data visualizations are, but leave out the most expensive and time-consuming part of the process: preparing and integrating the data. Why? Perhaps because most self-service technologies fall short when pulling together information that is drawn from multiple systems.

In this session, learn how  businesses and IT can use Power Query--a free data integration tool and part of Power BI--to transform, combine, and share data from heterogeneous data sources, reducing the time and cost to prepare the data that is used to produce analysis and reports. We also discuss how Power Query fits in the larger BI landscape and the considerations and concerns that IT stakeholders have when adopting this type of self-service technology.

## Speaker(s): Scott Currie
## Title: Create and Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour
## Description:
### Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) automates your BI patterns and eliminates the manual repetition that consumes most of your SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) development time. This one-hour  presentation uses the free BIDSHelper add-in for BIDS and SSDT to introduce Biml and to automatically generate large quantities of custom SSIS packages. The session is largely demo-driven, and reusable sample code is distributed for you to use in your own projects.

Using a live-typing approach, we start from scratch and by the end of the session, we create a full-blown staging environment. This includes the creation of hundreds of target table creation scripts, data load packages, data scrubbing rules, logging, and more. The best part is that you can freely reuse the code in your own environment simply by changing the connection strings, or you can make small changes to implement your own data load patterns.

## Speaker(s): Erin Stellato
## Title: Statistics and Query Plans
## Description:
### If you want to tune queries, you have to look at query plans and you have to understand what they’re showing you.  One thing people look for when tuning is “bad cardinality estimates”.  If you’ve wondered what that means, and you want to understand how the optimizer uses statistics when creating a query plan, then join me for this session on statistics and query plans.  We’ll set the stage with a review of what statistics are, then see how the optimizer uses them and where to find that “cardinality estimate” information in a plan.  We’ll also cover the various ways statistics can be updated, explore what happens to plans when those updates occur, and ultimately you will see why understanding how it all works is critical when you’re troubleshooting performance issues.  Expect lots of demos so you can truly understand what statistics are, how they're used, and why their management is so essential for good performance.

## Speaker(s): Luke Jian
## Title: Anatomy of an Optimizer
## Description:
### In this session, we look in depth at how the query processor works and show you what operations it performs during query optimization to generate equivalent query plans and find a “good enough” plan with limited time during  query optimization.
We demonstrate how to use documented  trace flags to look at the transformation rules that the optimizer has available.

With each SQL Server version, new transformation  rules  are introduced, changing the way the query  optimization process works and sometimes dramatically improving  performance.
We look in depth at  some of the most important transformation rules introduced in the SQL Server 2014  optimizer, explain their importance, and demonstrate how they work while comparing the results with older versions of SQL Server.
We explain why query optimization complexity increases exponentially  with the number of tables  included in the plan, and how to diagnose and remedy issues that relate to bad query plans.

## Speaker(s): Michael Rys
## Title: U-SQL: ‘THE’ Language for Big Data
## Description:
### SQL has been a favorite language for database developers and administrators for decades. However, over the last couple of years, data processing is increasingly moving towards Big Data processing and is posing some new demands on not just scalability but also the ability to query late-structured data. With Azure Data Lake we’re introducing a new SQL-based language called U-SQL, that combines the familiarity of SQL with new extensions for Big Data processing and easier user-extensibility.

In this presentation you will learn the concepts behind the new language and see examples of how to use it to query unstructured, semi-structured and structured data. It will show the similarities to the SQL and database objects you know and call out some of the important differences.

## Speaker(s): Bob Ward
## Title: Inside Wait Types, Latches, and Spinlocks
## Description:
### In the lifecycle of execution of the SQL Server engine, threads and workers can spend a great deal of time waiting. Understanding the most common scenarios and how to react to them can be critical in managing and configuring your SQL Server but also help you build efficient and optimal database applications. In this session, we will go deep into the most common wait types, understand which ones you can safely ignore, and also understand how waiting works in the engine and how to debug any wait type. And yes, that will involve the use of technologies such as Extended Events and the Windows Debugger. Latches are one of the least understood forms of waiting in the engine so this session will include a deep drive on how latches work, and how you can debug and resolve issues with them. We will also spend time with a deeper look at spinlocks. In our modern age of high-end servers with many NUMA nodes and dense cores, spinlocks have become visible as a “wait type” to debug and handle. We will spend time to ensure you know what spinlocks are, how to recognize them as an issue, and how to address them. Since this is a half-day session, I know you will want demos and there will be plenty of them using a wide variety of tools including Extended Events, DMVs, the Windows Debugger, scripts, and sysinternals tools.
 
This session is not for the faint of heart. We will cover a lot of material in a short time-frame, enough to make your own head spin(lock). And we will also move at a fast pace. This is a 500 level session where we will go deep into the internals of SQL Server as you learn the how, what, and why of wait types, latches, and spinlocks. Having said that, you will come up away with practical advice, tools, and tips you can use right way to use in your SQL Server environment. This session will be based on SQL Server 2012 and 2014 but many of the concepts we talk about can apply to previous versions. As a bonus we will discuss any relevant changes for SQL Server 2016 and how Azure database applications are affected by these topics.

# How Minimal Is Minimal Logging?
#### [Back to calendar](#id-42)
Event Date: 29-10-2015 15:15 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: How Minimal Is Minimal Logging?
## Description:
### SQL Server always logs every change to a database. But exactly what is logged can vary based on a number of factors. Some operations are referred to as "minimally logged," but even those operations can log a different level of detail depending on your recovery model. 

This session looks inside the transaction log to see exactly what is logged for minimally logged operations. First, we look at some background information regarding how the log is used and managed, and then we introduce a tool that can help you actually see your log records. 

When you can query the log, you can determine how logging for operations such as index rebuilds and SELECT INTO differs depending on whether you are using the FULL or BULK_LOGGED recovery model. We also look at other factors in our SQL Server operations that can affect what is actually written to the log.

## Description:
### R is the world’s most widely used statistics programming language and the first choice of data scientists, supported by a vibrant and talented community of contributors. However, in order to fully embrace R in enterprise settings, one must consider a range of aspects including performance, scale, security, manageability and application development. In SQL Server 2016 we enable these scenarios by delivering advanced analytics as an additional workload with proven technology from Revolution Analytics. During the session we highlight the benefits of bringing the compute closer to the data. We will also share the value proposition for data scientists, developers and administrators, and we will see demos illustrating data exploration and predictive application development on top of your SQL Server data.

## Speaker(s): Mark Broadbent
## Title: Lock, Block, and Two Smoking Barrels
## Description:
### SQL Server is a high-performance relational engine and provides a highly scalable database platform. But because of its complexity (and bad programming practices), it can be prone to serious concurrency problems, unexpected behaviors, lost updates, and more.

In SQL Server 2005, two optimistic concurrency mechanisms were introduced and touted as the solution to all our problems. In SQL Server 2012 and 2014, even more mechanisms followed, but challenges and problems remain.

We take a long look into the world of SQL Server concurrency and investigate pessimistic and optimistic isolation, how they work, when you should use them, and when they can go very wrong. Don't find yourself staring down the wrong end of SQL Server's two smoking barrels--join us for this revealing and thought-provoking presentation.

Leave this session knowing why indexes are just as important as table design and with the confidence and skills to improve the performance of your database.

We start with an understanding of the different index types and review the common pitfalls of indexing. Then, we quickly move to showing how you can identify index usage to determine whether there are not enough, too many, or even duplicates in the databases you manage.  Our balance is achieved when we look at SQL Server 2014 and the options provided.

## Speaker(s): Jason Thomas
## Title: Memoirs of Building a 150 GB (and Growing) SSAS Tabular Model
## Description:
### With their in-memory capabilities and state-of-the-art data compression algorithms, tabular models are an automatic choice for many customers. Many models end up being 50 GB or less, achieving compression of 10x to 100x the database size. But if you ask industry experts what would be a safe size range for a tabular model performance wise, the most common answer would be "It depends." In this session, we try to find the answer. Watch and learn all the processes and rationale behind building a huge tabular model, starting from size estimations and hardware selections. Contemplate design decisions (especially  multidimensional versus tabular) and off-the-road architecture while trying to balance processing and query performance. Watch for performance optimizations and development tips and tricks that you definitely do not want to miss, while working on the tabular model. Above all, see the performance statistics for yourself!

## Speaker(s): Hope Foley
## Title: Don't Rely on Magic: Tabular Performance Troubleshooting 
## Description:
### You often hear that one of the major advantages of using the tabular model is ease of use and implementation. So that must mean that it will run like a super fast dream all the time out of the box, forever and ever, right?  Not exactly. For the best possible performance, you need to consider many things at the time of modeling and implementation. If you later run into trouble with reports and queries, what do you do?  This session goes through the process to troubleshoot performance of tabular models and queries, to keep things running as fast as possible. Just because tabular is easy to use doesn't mean you can't tune it when it doesn't run as fast as you want. This session focuses on building a methodology for troubleshooting tabular performance so that you can get that super fast dream machine.

* Connect to multiple data sources and combine data from them in Power Query
* Create parameterized queries in Power Query and pass parameters to them from your Excel worksheet, so that users can load only the data they need
* Build an SSRS-like user interface for your reports in Excel
* Get the best possible performance in Power Query, using query folding
* Learn about the pros and cons of loading data to the Excel Data Model or Power Pivot and using Excel tables
* Use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) queries to query data in the Excel Data Model or Power Pivot
* Refresh data with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)

## Speaker(s): Matan Yungman
## Title: The Data-Loading Performance Presentation
## Description:
### Loading huge amounts of data into SQL Server can be a challenging task. Quite a few factors can help or hurt your attempts.

For that, Microsoft has published a famous whitepaper called "The Data Loading Performance Guide". The problem is that it's long and full of details, and most of us are too busy (or too lazy) to read it.

In this session, we turn the whitepaper into a presentation and talk about the ways you can optimize your massive data-loading processes by applying the techniques therein. We also discuss other advanced techniques that have emerged since the whitepaper was published.

Among other topics, we talk about the #1 enemy of high-performance data loading, minimal logging, bulk load, indexing techniques, properly leveraging parallelism and partitioning, SQL Server 2014 delayed durability, and more.

## Speaker(s): Victor Isakov
## Title: Designing a Database Solution to Store Large Volumes of Documents
## Description:
### What is the best solution for storing a large volume of documents in your SQL Server database solution? What are the performance, availability, backup and storage implications for storing millions of PDF, TXT, TIFF and Microsoft Office documents in SQL Server? Microsoft has deprecated the IMAGE data type since SQL Server 2005. With VARBINARY, FILESTREAM, or FILETABLE and the file system itself available as options what are the benefits and considerations of each? In this session we will examine these options and how to best configure SQL Server and Windows to realise the optimal solution. Architecting the optimal solution can mean the difference between 40 minutes and over 5 hours for a full database backup! With a 5TB database as a case study we will show you a practical example of how the solution was re-architected and the compression, deduplication and business benefits that can be achieved.

## Speaker(s): André Kamman
## Title: Analyzing your ETL Solution with PowerShell
## Description:
### Some ETL solutions have built-in mapping so that you can easily find the parts that need to change when you want to change something in the sources or destinations. Unfortunately, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) does not have this functionality, so finding which package uses which columns in your databases and source files is not always easy. Fortunately, PowerShell can do this task for you. This session shows you how to analyze a few hundred SSIS packages and even make changes, if needed. After this session, you will know how to more easily estimate how much work proposed changes to your sources or destinations require in your ETL solution.

What if you can stretch an existing SQL Server table to Azure little or no application changes? Data is moved securely and transparently. Standard TSQL queries continue to work as-is regardless of where the data is stored. Backup/restore just hot data while cold/archive data is automatically protected. Re-index only the few million rows of hot data though the table has billions of rows in total. 

All this while DBAs retains full control from the on-prem SQL Server even if advanced security features such as row level security or encryption is employed. Come learn how you can with Stretch Database.

## Speaker(s): Jason Brimhall
## Title: Working with Object Compression in SQL Server
## Description:
### SQL Server 2008 introduced object compression to the DBA toolkit. We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server. What you might not know boils down to some subtleties of compression. For example, not all page compressed objects are entirely page compressed. Many pages can be uncompressed or just row-compressed.
 
This session shows you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level. At the lower level, this session also shows how to determine compression settings of objects in the database. You can use both some undocumented and more commonly known commands to derive some interesting information from the database engine.

## Speaker(s): Dan Bulos
## Title: Dashboard Design for Maximum Impact
## Description:
### How can you design a useful and appealing dashboard? While choosing key performance indicators (KPIs), charts, and tables are important, a dashboard is more than just an onscreen collection of charts and tables. To paraphrase Stephen Few, a dashboard should display the most important information to achieve objectives that can be monitored at a glance.  

The first task is choosing a dashboard type and purpose. This session reviews a framework to determine the theme and content of a dashboard. We look at common graphical content and how to use tables in a dashboard. We also examine table-specific content such as microcharts, icons, and exception highlighting.  

Dashboard layout and flow is not covered in the literature about dashboards but is important.  Which content should be adjacent on the dashboard? How do you arrange content that should be scanned in a particular order? We review how to arrange dashboard content and set up appropriate navigation.

# Testing SSIS Packages

Event Date: 30-10-2015 14:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Tim Mitchell
## Title: Testing SSIS Packages
## Description:
### Senior developer: “How do you test your code?” Junior developer: “I compile it.” It’s an old joke, but too often this reflects the reality of testing. If the code compiles, it has passed its test. Sadly, this principle is sometimes applied to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as well: “When the SSIS package runs without error, testing is complete.” 

As in software development, testing of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages should not end at when the package executes successfully. You must also confirm that the package does what it was intended to do without placing an undue performance burden on the system.

This session walks through design patterns for testing SSIS packages during and after the development process. The session covers topics such as these:
* Performance testing
* Patterns for validating execution results at runtime
* Validating package metadata before execution
* Design time versus runtime testing
* Making a graceful exit: testing for error handling

## Speaker(s): Warner Chaves
## Title: Time to Stretch: Scaling out and in with Azure DB Elastic Scale
## Description:
### Elasticity is one of the main promises of cloud computing. The cloud has given us the ability to add or remove resources and dynamically respond to our workload volume to allow for cost efficient, high performing solutions. 

However, dynamically scaling the database tier can be difficult due to having to deal with distribution schemes, data movement, application routing and the actual increase or decrease of the database resources. 

Azure SQL Database and the Elastic Scale .NET API combine to provide a solution to these challenges in an easy to use but powerful set of capabilities. In this session we will demo the main building blocks of the Elastic Scale API, how they combine with SQL Azure and how to bring database elasticity in your own application!
