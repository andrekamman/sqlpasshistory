# New SQL Server 2016 Security Features for Developers
#### [Back to calendar](#id-803)
Event Date: 14-11-2017 21:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Build
## Speaker(s): Lenni Lobel
## Title: New SQL Server 2016 Security Features for Developers
## Description:
### With the release of SQL Server 2016, the database engine has been greatly enhanced for security, with three new features that you’ll learn about in this demo-packed session. With dynamic data masking (DDM), you can fully or partially conceal sensitive columns from query results. Masking does not modify data on in the table, it simply hides data from users that don’t have permission to see it. 
Row-level security (RLS) also hides data from unauthorized users, but at the row level. With RLS, you can create your own security policy to control which users can read or write specific rows in the table. Finally, Always Encrypted (AE) uses client-side encryption to ensure that data is encrypted in flight, not just at rest. Furthermore, the encryption keys are accessible only to the client. This guarantees that data cannot be decrypted on the server, easing the migration path to the cloud for users with highly sensitive data.

Learning Objectives:
1) Learn how dynamic data masking (DDM) can hide sensitive columns from unauthorized users
2) Examine row-level security (RLS) to filter or block individual rows from different users
3) Explore Always Encrypted (AE), a new client-side database encryption technology available in SQL Server 201
