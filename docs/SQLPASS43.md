## Speaker(s): Rob Collie, Avi Singh
## Title: Join the Power BI & Excel Revolution
## Description:
### Power BI is a multi-faceted technology “wave” that can be thought of as “Business Intelligence finally becoming accessible.”  But we think it is also VERY useful to view it as “a revolution in Excel’s analysis and reporting capabilities.”

Either way though, once armed with its industrial-strength depth, you will conquer an unlimited spectrum of analytical, reporting and modeling needs.  We repeatedly see dramatically improved productivity, efficiency, and profitability within a matter of days.
 
In this full-day session, Rob Collie and Avi Singh have filtered their many years of “Modern Excel” and Power BI education, writing, and consulting experience down to the things anyone can learn AND retain in a short period of time, while simultaneously building a confident foundation for future learning.  Together you will take a 100% human and pragmatic approach.  

Their recipe, geared toward absolute beginners, will give you analytical superpowers, broken into five easy-to-follow segments:

1. Roadmap – we will literally give you maps that demystify Microsoft’s rapidly-evolving offerings in this space.

2. Fundamentals – short and simple, these fit onto a single 6-step flowchart (provided).

3. Patterns – “recipes” that you can easily follow and modify to solve business problems, without requiring PhD-level mastery.

4. Priorities – Focused on the capabilities that are most “bang for the buck.”  Avoids topics that are too complex or too “niche.”

5. Examples – no reference guide beats a working example that you can revisit when needed.  Each student takes home dozens of working examples.
 
The only prerequisite is to enjoy data.  Join us for the revolution.

## Speaker(s): Dean Abbott
## Title: An Overview of Predictive Analytics for Practitioners
## Description:
### Predictive Analytics (PA) has emerged as a “go to” approach to creating data-driven business decisions. The science of PA is not new, the algorithms are not new.

# The Pain and Glory of Data Preparation

Event Date: 21-04-2015 09:45 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Discover & Integrate
## Speaker(s): Oz du Soleil
## Title: The Pain and Glory of Data Preparation
## Description:
### Data science, predictive analysis … the glamourous stuff makes headlines. But one realm of analytics is only for the bold. It takes a special kind of person to merge, purge, cleanse, and shape data in preparation for the fancy jobs. Without this dirty work, analysis can go wrong. The results can range from embarrassment to imprisonment.

This dirty part of analytics isn’t formally taught. There are no standard tricks for cleaning data. Strategy and experience are the data warrior's weapons.

People who can clean and shape data are true heroes: They can remove duplicates, get data into the right fields, merge data, and so on. Sometimes it’s elegant. Other times, it’s ugly. The result is that any, analysis, and suggestions are rooted in trustworthy data quality.

In this session, you’ll learn strategies for assessing data quality, tips for cleaning and shaping data and determining how clean is “clean enough”, ideas for creating policies and processes that can guide you when working with unclean data, and which Excel features are most useful during prep work.

# Big Data and the Data Lake from the Analyst Perspective
#### [Back to calendar](#id-43)
Event Date: 21-04-2015 09:45 - Category: Lab (120 minutes) - Track: Unlocking Big Data
## Speaker(s): Scott Shaw
## Title: Big Data and the Data Lake from the Analyst Perspective
## Description:
### 2-Hour Lab

The concept of a data lake is emerging as a popular way to organize and build the next generation of data systems to master new big data challenges. Organizations are seeking to create data lakes because they manage and use data with increased volume, variety, and unprecedented velocity.  However, how can data professionals and analysts access the data lake for the expected insights at the velocity required by the business?  
 
In this session, we will take every day relevant business scenarios to learn how to spring business value from data held in the data lake, in order to answer key questions:
 
•	How do we import structured, semi-structured and unstructured data into our data lake? 

•	How can we access unstructured and semi-structured data to derive value for the enterprise? 

•	How do we do analytics and reporting over the data lake in Hadoop? 

•	What are the similarities and differences between accessing data held in a data lake in terms of architecture and syntax?
 
In terms of the technology, we will springboard from SQL to learn how to do familiar activities such as import, access and visualise data in our data lake. To do this, we will use technology such as Hive, Hue, and the Hadoop Distributed Files System (HDFS) as a data source.
 
Come and join us for this practical two hour session which will build on your existing SQL skills to demystify Big Data and the Data Lake for analysts. This session is aimed at people who want to keep pace with the latest Big Data technology by adopting the latest techniques to explore the data lake, building on their existing analytical knowledge.

## Speaker(s): Avi Singh
## Title: The Art of Power BI Visualization: Create Reports That Help You Run Your Business
## Description:
### Power BI (Dashboard and Power View) offers a sexy visualization tool. But it is unlike other tools you may have worked with and can even be frustrating at times.

# Increased Margins, Period:  Modern Excel and the Bottom Line
#### [Back to calendar](#id-43)
Event Date: 21-04-2015 09:45 - Category: Breakout Session (120 minutes) - Track: Analyze & Interpret
## Speaker(s): Rob Collie
## Title: Increased Margins, Period:  Modern Excel and the Bottom Line
## Description:
### The Bottom Line:  it’s so synonymous with “nothing else really matters” that it has become its own cliché even OUTSIDE the business world.

But it often seems like the reporting and analytics world didn't get the message.  Why, for instance, is “Sales Dollars” the most commonly-reported metric when only MARGINS truly matter?

In this session, Rob Collie will show you how Modern Excel, with its suite of Power BI tools, helps us dramatically kick those bad habits.  He will provide you with a step-by-step methodology for “working backwards” from the impact you need, coming full circle to delivering that impact in less than a day.  Using a live case study as a backdrop, you will see everything - from sketches and data prep to formulas and dashboards.  

Your job is then to take this approach, which has saved individual clients millions of dollars per year, back to your own business.  And to your own bottom line.

# The Data Supply Chain: Maximizing Value Throughout the Cycle
#### [Back to calendar](#id-43)
Event Date: 21-04-2015 11:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Analyze & Interpret
## Speaker(s): Hyoun Park
## Title: The Data Supply Chain: Maximizing Value Throughout the Cycle
## Description:
### Enterprise data is no longer simply structured, internal, or scheduled in nature. In today’s world, where every knowledge worker is asked to make “data-driven decisions,” it is incredibly challenging to support all of the forms of data requested by employees. To translate data into business insights, data analysts have to think about how the data will be presented. This means understanding where the data came from, who requested the data, who will actually receive the data, and how the data will be presented in its final form. Each of these considerations must be fully considered to maximize the value of data.

By fully considering the full “supply chain” of data from source to consumption, data analysts can insure that their data extraction, quality, and integration are fully appreciated by the end user whether it be an employee, partner, customer, or other interested party.

## Speaker(s): James Kobielus
## Title: Unlocking Big Data: The Power of Cognitive Computing
## Description:
### Cognitive computing – the ability of automated systems to learn and interact naturally with people to extend what either human or machine could do on their own – helps us drill through large volumes of data rapidly to make better decisions. Cognitive computing performance improves over time as systems build knowledge and learn a domain’s language and terminology, its processes, and its preferred methods of interacting. See why cognitive computing applications are at the very heart of the Big Data-analytics revolution and how they are fast becoming among the most transformative tools in modern business.

## Speaker(s): Dipak Bhudia, Minnie Park
## Title: Self Service Business Intelligence: Helping Businesses Help Themselves 
## Description:
### Considered a fairytale for businesses, but feared as a nightmare for IT who choose to safeguard data behind hordes of business analysts, report designers, sql developers, QA testers and release management. Do all these layers truly need to exist in business intelligence? Giving businesses the freedom to explore and analyze in a collaborative environment speeds up insights not simply by 10%, 20% or 50%, but by magnitudes of 2 to 6 fold! This is a ridiculous increase in productivity that simply cannot be ignored. 

This session will cover a real-world use-case of how one of the worlds largest banks implemented self-service and agile BI methodologies to give their risk officers the tools necessary to deliver datapoints required by a rapidly growing number of regulatory bodies during the aftermath of the financial crisis.

See how some IT departments are evolving from report delivery to data delivery, letting businesses handle the dynamic query and representation whilst IT can observe and monitor how businesses use the data. This ‘BI-on-BI’ helps focus scarce IT resources to delivering even higher quality data where it matters most.

## Speaker(s): Brandon Purcell
## Title: Open for Business: Leveraging Open Data to Gain Advantage on the Competition
## Description:
### Recently, data has become the new energy source of some of the world’s largest organizations. While heavy emphasis has been placed on data collected from internal company sources, open data—data from governmental sources that is publicly available-- provides an additional boost to uncover key competitive insights, changes in market share, compliance risks, growth opportunities and more. Based on Beyond the Arc’s on-going analysis of open data sources, such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), Brandon Purcell will provide his data science expertise on the methods businesses should adopt to operationalize open data, rather than ignoring a potential goldmine of information.  Real-world application examples will include:

• Mining the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau database to prevent customer complaints

• Leveraging the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database for competitive analysis

• Integrating open data with internal data sources and social media. Relevant technologies: R, Excel

## Speaker(s): Richard Lee
## Title: Embracing The Data Leadership Nexus to Achieve Strategic Success
## Description:
### As momentum grows towards the full exploitation of Big Data & Analytics as a source of competitive advantage, the necessity for the CEO, the Board and the entire Senior Executive Team to assume full accountability for these endeavors has never been paramount. Big Data & Analytics as strategic enablers are no longer the domain of IT.

The Data Leadership Nexus is the intersection of; Top-Down Executive Leadership, a fully-aligned Organizational Culture and the use of Data (Big or Small), Information & Analytics as Core Competencies. It is the path to Strategic Success in becoming a Predictive Enterprise and it the linchpin of every Organization’s Strategic Plan for building & sustaining “a Culture of Evidence-based Decisioning”.

In my presentation I will dive deeper into all aspects of the Data Leadership Nexus and lay the groundwork for you to use in leveraging it as your Strategic Framework.

## Speaker(s): Daniel Fylstra
## Title: Beyond What-If:  How to Build Analytic and Decision Models in Spreadsheets
## Description:
### 2-Hour Lab 

Countless ads and articles from software vendors claim that you need to “outgrow the spreadsheet” and learn a whole new platform and language (theirs) in order to build analytic models and solve decision problems.  Yet virtually all these tools feature “Excel import/export” buttons, and meanwhile tons of users have built analytic and decision models directly in Excel, often getting big payoffs.  So, can you do it?  Sure you can, but it requires a somewhat different way of thinking about your spreadsheet model, and more than simple calculation.  In this hands-on session, you will do it!  We’ll walk you through creation of Solver models for optimization, Monte Carlo simulation models for risk analysis, decision analysis models and more in Excel 2013, running on supplied PCs at your lab room seat.  Analytic decision models are very often based on the summarized data we get from business intelligence tools – so we’ll use Power Pivot and Power Query to retrieve, summarize and deliver the data we need for our Excel-based analytic models.

## Speaker(s): Jack Mardack
## Title: The Analytics of Growth Hacking
## Description:
### From his perspective as the head of growth at such companies as Eventbrite, Prezi and Chartcube, Jack will talk to you about the "special analytics" attendant to the practice of Growth Hacking at software companies. Jack will talk about the installation of analytics, analytics strategy used to facilitate growth hacking, how data gets processed, visualized and turned into actionable insight to drive growth. 


Analytics Model Overview
We'll take a look at how growth hacking perspective drives the strategy and implementation of analytics. Jack will give a high-level architectural overview, and talk about some of the components used in each part: logging, log processing (ETL), dashboards, ad-hoc querying. He will touch on how the parts fit together, and talk about the typical data model: people, objects, events, metadata.

Jack will offer some examples from Prezi and Chartcube. He will talk about how the Prezi growth team built additional analytics on the existing Hadoop stack, adding hundreds of individual daily metrics to serve their needs, how they enriched user metadata and created new data architectures that were used by the whole company. He will look at how they used perspective and data to attack the user activation problem, and how they discovered the agency of content in the user life cycle through exploratory analysis. Jack will talk about how the situational differences between companies that have some users, versus zero users, impact the analytics strategy, and discuss how analytics serves user discovery in early-stage companies, and how they use data to consider the problem of product/market fit.

You should come away with a good understanding of how software companies leverage analytics for growth. Many of the analytical strategies and principles should transfer and have relevance for people working outside of software.

# Dynamic Presentation Using Excel CUBE Formulas

Event Date: 22-04-2015 13:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Visualize & Inform
## Speaker(s): Bob Phillips
## Title: Dynamic Presentation Using Excel CUBE Formulas
## Description:
### Self-service BI is a great idea, with the Microsoft suite of Power tools going a long way to delivering this idea. For sophisticated users that can build models and analyse data using pivot tables, this is a great and effective solution. But what about the rest, those who just need results that they can use in their day job, the managers who just need the figures to help them make decisions?
 
Dashboards with good charts and graphics go some ways to delivering information for such users, but often a good table of results will give the correct amount of detail to gain the necessary insights, and is easy to read. With the aptly named CUBE formulas, Excel has the capability to read data directly from a data cube in the spreadsheet. This is a great way to build structured output in Excel, in the form of a simple table. The problem with this approach is in managing the data changes, changes in the underlying data can mean more or fewer rows of data to show in your table.
 
This session is not intending to explain how to use those CUBE formulae, although using them in the presentation will show their usage, as it is assumed that the audience at least knows of them and what they each do. Instead, the emphasis is on showing how to use other Excel formulas to manage the output, building a truly dynamic display that caters for changes in the size of the underlying data, whilst also handling those ugly #REF errors that can occur when users insert or delete rows above the output table.
 
Given time, we will add a little MDX to the formulas to show further dynamic capability.

### Inventory Valuation is a common problem in accounting, for which you might already have a dedicated software. From this point of view, a Tabular model should be only a reporting tool for data processed by other tools. However, the powerful in-memory engine allows alternative approaches to this problem, making it possible to do simulation and recalculation in minutes instead of hours. This technique, based on a combined use of Tabular models and DAX expressions, allows the implementation of more granular and accurate techniques in Inventory Valuation. This session shows several approaches to this scenario, using Analysis Services Tabular as a calculation engine to speed-up complete recalculation of Inventory Valuation caused by corrections to old transactions or particularly complex requirements in calculation definition.

## Title: Optimizing your Power Pivot models using Power Query (and other performance tips)
## Description:
### 2-Hour Lab

You know the scene; you've built a beautiful Power Pivot model that has solved all of your organization’s problems.  You open it up, click Refresh and wait patiently for all the data to stream in.  That’s okay, there’s a lot of data and you expect that.  Then you click a slicer and… wait…

Time during the initial data load is one thing, but consumer’s patience during use is another.  Their tolerance for latency is much less.
In this session we’ll explore the things you can do to increase your Power Pivot model performance.  We’ll look at the key factors that affect performance, as well as the things you can do to deal with them.  In addition, we’ll look at how sourcing your data with Power Query can give you ultimate control over your data’s size and shape, and tricks to optimize it for Power Pivot consumption.

## Speaker(s): Andrew J. Brust
## Title: Using Hadoop with Excel and Power BI, Plus Data Discovery 101
## Description:
### Want to get up to speed on Big Data, BI and how they can work together, using technology from Microsoft and several of its competitors?  This back-to-back session from Andrew Brust, Gigaom Research Director for Big Data and Analytics, will get you there, with little prior knowledge required.

We’ll start by looking at Apache Hadoop, including its architecture, capabilities, and how to work with it directly.  Then we’ll move up a couple of layers of abstraction and see how we can query Hadoop data using Excel, Power Query, Power View and Power BI.  This will be a guided tour of Big Data technology and practical, approachable ways to work with that data using Microsoft’s BI tools.

From that focused look at Power BI, we’ll transition into an investigation of other self-service data discovery tools. We’ll look at tools from several vendors, including Tableau, Qlik and Jaspersoft.  We’ll see how these tools compare to Microsoft’s, how they connect to Hadoop and we’ll learn about the commonalities between the products.

## Title: Advanced Excel Add-Ins
## Description:
### Anybody can create an add-in for Excel. They're fast to create and easy to setup. Creating one which will work right out of the gates can take some time. In this session we will discuss an overview of "why" and "when" to go the route of an add-in. This session will assume you already know what an add-in is and how to create one, and will be targeted to a more advanced audience, perhaps those who've already created several add-ins.

In many cases your business may have a resident Excel expert on-hand, or that might even be you. Going for outside help or consultancy can be an extremely expensive endeavor (not to mention how many bad developers there are). This means any add-in need which comes up could be handled by the resident guru. Is that you?

Ranging from logical coding scenarios to shared add-ins over a network, this session will have pearls for your guru. Add-Ins can give your tools a beautiful and elegant UI and save you and your users countless hours of work by automating tasks.

## Title: Pulling Back the Green Curtain: Data Forensics, Power BI, and Dataviz
## Description:
### In the Wizard of Oz, Toto pulls back the green curtain to expose that the Wizard of Oz is a fraud. In this session, we will look behind the 'green curtain' of the data visualisation to learn how to 'poke holes' in the data that you are given, both in business and in everyday news headlines. In order to explode the myths in the data that surrounds us every day, we can look for deviations from these patterns in the data. We will learn how to use both data visualisation in Power BI combined with timeless data analysis to reveal or conceal efforts to distort the numbers, and question the veracity of the data. In the Wizard of Oz, Toto was the only character with courage, heart and wisdom. You'll need all three to analyse data, since truthful data doesn't necessarily give easy answers! Join us to learn more about how to pull back the green curtain on your data, and to follow the yellow brick road to expose the stories hidden in your data.
