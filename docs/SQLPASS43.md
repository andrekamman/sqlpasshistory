## Title: Unlocking Big Data: The Power of Cognitive Computing
## Description:
### Cognitive computing – the ability of automated systems to learn and interact naturally with people to extend what either human or machine could do on their own – helps us drill through large volumes of data rapidly to make better decisions. Cognitive computing performance improves over time as systems build knowledge and learn a domain’s language and terminology, its processes, and its preferred methods of interacting. See why cognitive computing applications are at the very heart of the Big Data-analytics revolution and how they are fast becoming among the most transformative tools in modern business.

## Speaker(s): Dipak Bhudia, Minnie Park
## Title: Self Service Business Intelligence: Helping Businesses Help Themselves 
## Description:
### Considered a fairytale for businesses, but feared as a nightmare for IT who choose to safeguard data behind hordes of business analysts, report designers, sql developers, QA testers and release management. Do all these layers truly need to exist in business intelligence? Giving businesses the freedom to explore and analyze in a collaborative environment speeds up insights not simply by 10%, 20% or 50%, but by magnitudes of 2 to 6 fold! This is a ridiculous increase in productivity that simply cannot be ignored. 

This session will cover a real-world use-case of how one of the worlds largest banks implemented self-service and agile BI methodologies to give their risk officers the tools necessary to deliver datapoints required by a rapidly growing number of regulatory bodies during the aftermath of the financial crisis.

See how some IT departments are evolving from report delivery to data delivery, letting businesses handle the dynamic query and representation whilst IT can observe and monitor how businesses use the data. This ‘BI-on-BI’ helps focus scarce IT resources to delivering even higher quality data where it matters most.

## Speaker(s): Daniel Fylstra
## Title: Beyond What-If:  How to Build Analytic and Decision Models in Spreadsheets
## Description:
### 2-Hour Lab 

Countless ads and articles from software vendors claim that you need to “outgrow the spreadsheet” and learn a whole new platform and language (theirs) in order to build analytic models and solve decision problems.  Yet virtually all these tools feature “Excel import/export” buttons, and meanwhile tons of users have built analytic and decision models directly in Excel, often getting big payoffs.  So, can you do it?  Sure you can, but it requires a somewhat different way of thinking about your spreadsheet model, and more than simple calculation.  In this hands-on session, you will do it!  We’ll walk you through creation of Solver models for optimization, Monte Carlo simulation models for risk analysis, decision analysis models and more in Excel 2013, running on supplied PCs at your lab room seat.  Analytic decision models are very often based on the summarized data we get from business intelligence tools – so we’ll use Power Pivot and Power Query to retrieve, summarize and deliver the data we need for our Excel-based analytic models.

## Speaker(s): David Smith
## Title: Real-Time Big Data Analytics with R 
## Description:
### Data-driven decision-making in today’s competitive climate means deploying statistical models into production environments. Every company that relies on predictive models to drive their applications and operations has a different process for model deployment. In this talk, I’ll draw on case studies from my work with data-driven companies to distil some best practices for creating and deploying real-time advanced analytics applications. I’ll give particular attention to the R programming language, which has emerged as the standard framework for building and deploying predictive models. I’ll also give some guidance for addressing some of the challenges that come with the conflict between “real time” and “big data” and offer some solutions for predictive modeling on data where it resides: in the database, or in Hadoop.

# The Analytics of Growth Hacking
#### [Back to calendar](#id-43)
Event Date: 22-04-2015 13:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Visualize & Inform
## Speaker(s): Jack Mardack
## Title: The Analytics of Growth Hacking
## Description:
### From his perspective as the head of growth at such companies as Eventbrite, Prezi and Chartcube, Jack will talk to you about the "special analytics" attendant to the practice of Growth Hacking at software companies. Jack will talk about the installation of analytics, analytics strategy used to facilitate growth hacking, how data gets processed, visualized and turned into actionable insight to drive growth. 


Analytics Model Overview
We'll take a look at how growth hacking perspective drives the strategy and implementation of analytics. Jack will give a high-level architectural overview, and talk about some of the components used in each part: logging, log processing (ETL), dashboards, ad-hoc querying. He will touch on how the parts fit together, and talk about the typical data model: people, objects, events, metadata.

Jack will offer some examples from Prezi and Chartcube. He will talk about how the Prezi growth team built additional analytics on the existing Hadoop stack, adding hundreds of individual daily metrics to serve their needs, how they enriched user metadata and created new data architectures that were used by the whole company. He will look at how they used perspective and data to attack the user activation problem, and how they discovered the agency of content in the user life cycle through exploratory analysis. Jack will talk about how the situational differences between companies that have some users, versus zero users, impact the analytics strategy, and discuss how analytics serves user discovery in early-stage companies, and how they use data to consider the problem of product/market fit.

You should come away with a good understanding of how software companies leverage analytics for growth. Many of the analytical strategies and principles should transfer and have relevance for people working outside of software.

# Inventory Valuation Techniques with DAX and Tabular Models 
#### [Back to calendar](#id-43)
Event Date: 22-04-2015 13:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Analyze & Interpret
## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: Inventory Valuation Techniques with DAX and Tabular Models 
## Description:
### Inventory Valuation is a common problem in accounting, for which you might already have a dedicated software. From this point of view, a Tabular model should be only a reporting tool for data processed by other tools. However, the powerful in-memory engine allows alternative approaches to this problem, making it possible to do simulation and recalculation in minutes instead of hours. This technique, based on a combined use of Tabular models and DAX expressions, allows the implementation of more granular and accurate techniques in Inventory Valuation. This session shows several approaches to this scenario, using Analysis Services Tabular as a calculation engine to speed-up complete recalculation of Inventory Valuation caused by corrections to old transactions or particularly complex requirements in calculation definition.

## Title: Optimizing your Power Pivot models using Power Query (and other performance tips)
## Description:
### 2-Hour Lab

You know the scene; you've built a beautiful Power Pivot model that has solved all of your organization’s problems.  You open it up, click Refresh and wait patiently for all the data to stream in.  That’s okay, there’s a lot of data and you expect that.  Then you click a slicer and… wait…

Time during the initial data load is one thing, but consumer’s patience during use is another.  Their tolerance for latency is much less.
In this session we’ll explore the things you can do to increase your Power Pivot model performance.  We’ll look at the key factors that affect performance, as well as the things you can do to deal with them.  In addition, we’ll look at how sourcing your data with Power Query can give you ultimate control over your data’s size and shape, and tricks to optimize it for Power Pivot consumption.

## Description:
### In the Wizard of Oz, Toto pulls back the green curtain to expose that the Wizard of Oz is a fraud. In this session, we will look behind the 'green curtain' of the data visualisation to learn how to 'poke holes' in the data that you are given, both in business and in everyday news headlines. In order to explode the myths in the data that surrounds us every day, we can look for deviations from these patterns in the data. We will learn how to use both data visualisation in Power BI combined with timeless data analysis to reveal or conceal efforts to distort the numbers, and question the veracity of the data. In the Wizard of Oz, Toto was the only character with courage, heart and wisdom. You'll need all three to analyse data, since truthful data doesn't necessarily give easy answers! Join us to learn more about how to pull back the green curtain on your data, and to follow the yellow brick road to expose the stories hidden in your data.
