# Lessons Learned from a Successful Enterprise Power BI Deployment
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1075)
Event Date: 11-12-2019 16:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Steve Wake
## Title: Lessons Learned from a Successful Enterprise Power BI Deployment
## Description:
### Power BI is an amazing tool for end-user analytics and reporting, but if you don't architect for it correctly it may not work right as an enterprise reporting solution. 
Come to this session to get actual implementation details from a real deployment that was completed for a mid-sized company (1,500+ employees) and is being used daily by more than half of the employees after only a few months of being live in production. Using demos and actual documentation you will see what you need to think of for a project like this. We will be covering architecture, implementation, governance, change control, and support to get a Power BI enterprise deployment working successfully from someone that has done it! Azure Analysis Services, Power BI Pro, and Power BI Premium will be discussed and how each is being used in this solution as well.

# How to Do A Great Job When Working With (Data) Models
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1075)
Event Date: 11-12-2019 17:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: How to Do A Great Job When Working With (Data) Models
## Description:
### Power BI is a self-service Business Intelligence tool, which does a great job in hiding complexity and technology away from the user. But when it comes to performance and even correct numbers, one should spend some time in finding the right way of modelling the tables and how they are related to each other.

In this talk we spend an hour on doing exactly that. You will get answers to questions like: Why should you care about the data model? What kind of relations are available? How do they influence performance? Why redundancy is (not) a bad thing? 

Don’t only tell your friends that you are a professional who works with models but be actually great in doing it.

# "What's in a Name?" - Data Stories that Would Make the Bard Proud
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1075)
Event Date: 11-12-2019 18:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing
## Speaker(s): James McGillivray
## Title: "What's in a Name?" - Data Stories that Would Make the Bard Proud
## Description:
### Data on its own is useful, but boring. Data in story form makes people sit up and take notice. Every year, the U.S. Census Bureau compiles a data set of the names given to children born per state. 

In this session, we'll take this publicly available data set and use it to create an epic data story. You will learn how to identify key data points, visualize them effectively, and create a compelling narrative to present your findings to any type of audience. So, whether your data story is a history, a tragedy, or a thriller, you'll learn how to tell it in a way that will captivate and enthrall your audience.

# Agile Data Preparation with ADF Wrangling Data Flow
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1075)
Event Date: 11-12-2019 19:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Sergiy Lunyakin
## Title: Agile Data Preparation with ADF Wrangling Data Flow
## Description:
### Data Wrangling is becoming more and more popular in BigData and Enterprise world. Data Lake stores tons of different data and it is not easy to get value from it. To prepare data we need to write and test code that could take a while. But business requires to have results immediately and reduce time to market. In this session, I invite you to look together at Self-Service Data Prep and show how to use Power Query Online in Azure Data Factory Wrangling data flows for code-free data transformations via spark execution.

## Speaker(s): Anupama Natarajan
## Title: Accelerate the delivery of BI and AI solutions using Azure Synapse Analytics
## Description:
### Azure Synapse Analytics was recently announced by Microsoft at MS Ignite 2019 as a single cloud Analytics solution that bridges both Data Lakes and Data Warehouses. Organisations typically need data both in real time as well as for historical analysis. To meet this need they had to maintain two different solutions. Azure Synapse Analytics brings both Data Lakes and Data Warehouses together to provide Enterprise Analytics.

In this session, you will get to learn
•       What is Azure Synapse Analytics?
•       Features of Azure Synapse Analytics
•       Azure Synapse Architecture
•       Developing end-to-end Analytics solution

# 6 Months to 5 Minutes, Faster Deploys for Happier Users

Event Date: 11-12-2019 21:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Jan Mulkens
## Title: 6 Months to 5 Minutes, Faster Deploys for Happier Users
## Description:
### This is the story of how a team of 6 did everything they could to fight the status quo. From going against management demands and being the ugly duckling team to providing 4 other teams with a platform, services, and training.
Deploying to production can take us as little as 5 minutes these days while it used to take us 6 months.

We'll open the session with a demo of the technical tricks we used in our BI projects to improve our delivery speed.
Sadly enough, we noticed this barely made a dent in the 6 months it took us to deliver requests to our users.
So in the rest of the session, we'll go through the actions we took to shorten delivery time. And you'll learn the reasoning behind them, so you too can overcome organisational barriers to help speed up the delivery of value to your end users.
By the end of the session, you should have the knowledge to start your own journey to get your deployments from development to working in production in 5 minutes!

# Demystifying Chart Types and Report Design Principles in Power BI
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1075)
Event Date: 11-12-2019 22:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Reid Havens
## Title: Demystifying Chart Types and Report Design Principles in Power BI
## Description:
### Failing to deliver a well-designed Power BI Report can be a common reporting pitfall. What good is quality data if it is not presented in a way that is meaningful or easily understood? Someone without any prior knowledge should be able to quickly understand a report without explanation and be quickly drawn to the key elements you want them to view.  

This talk will walk through many elements of bad report design. Learn about visual cues and how certain chart types can convey data more accurately than others. Also, learn about the basic dos and don’ts of report design and layout, using easy-to-learn techniques that bring data to life.
