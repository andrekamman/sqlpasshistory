## Speaker(s): Steve Wake
## Title: Lessons Learned from a Successful Enterprise Power BI Deployment
## Description:
### Power BI is an amazing tool for end-user analytics and reporting, but if you don't architect for it correctly it may not work right as an enterprise reporting solution. 
Come to this session to get actual implementation details from a real deployment that was completed for a mid-sized company (1,500+ employees) and is being used daily by more than half of the employees after only a few months of being live in production. Using demos and actual documentation you will see what you need to think of for a project like this. We will be covering architecture, implementation, governance, change control, and support to get a Power BI enterprise deployment working successfully from someone that has done it! Azure Analysis Services, Power BI Pro, and Power BI Premium will be discussed and how each is being used in this solution as well.

## Speaker(s): Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: How to Do A Great Job When Working With (Data) Models
## Description:
### Power BI is a self-service Business Intelligence tool, which does a great job in hiding complexity and technology away from the user. But when it comes to performance and even correct numbers, one should spend some time in finding the right way of modelling the tables and how they are related to each other.

In this talk we spend an hour on doing exactly that. You will get answers to questions like: Why should you care about the data model? What kind of relations are available? How do they influence performance? Why redundancy is (not) a bad thing? 

Don’t only tell your friends that you are a professional who works with models but be actually great in doing it.

## Speaker(s): Sergiy Lunyakin
## Title: Agile Data Preparation with ADF Wrangling Data Flow
## Description:
### Data Wrangling is becoming more and more popular in BigData and Enterprise world. Data Lake stores tons of different data and it is not easy to get value from it. To prepare data we need to write and test code that could take a while. But business requires to have results immediately and reduce time to market. In this session, I invite you to look together at Self-Service Data Prep and show how to use Power Query Online in Azure Data Factory Wrangling data flows for code-free data transformations via spark execution.

## Speaker(s): Reid Havens
## Title: Demystifying Chart Types and Report Design Principles in Power BI
## Description:
### Failing to deliver a well-designed Power BI Report can be a common reporting pitfall. What good is quality data if it is not presented in a way that is meaningful or easily understood? Someone without any prior knowledge should be able to quickly understand a report without explanation and be quickly drawn to the key elements you want them to view.  

This talk will walk through many elements of bad report design. Learn about visual cues and how certain chart types can convey data more accurately than others. Also, learn about the basic dos and don’ts of report design and layout, using easy-to-learn techniques that bring data to life.
