Event Date: 06-11-2013 09:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Adam Machanic
## Title: No More Guessing! An Enlightened Approach to Performance Troubleshooting
## Description:
### Scratching your head, you stare at the screen. Should you rebuild an index? Create a new one? Reboot the server? Why is this query so slow?!? Figuring out performance problems can sometimes feel like fumbling your way through a dark room. Maybe you’ll get lucky and find the right solution?or maybe you’ll stub your toe. Either way, it’s a slow, potentially painful process. Yet finding the root cause of most performance issues is a simple exercise, once you understand where to look and when.

In this full-day seminar, you will learn a proven methodology that can be used to approach virtually any performance problem. Created and refined by Adam Machanic over several years, this strategy leverages core SQL Server performance tools (including dynamic management views, Extended Events, and WMI counters), applying them to various performance troubleshooting techniques (such as waits and queues analysis, baselining, and real-time activity monitoring). Each of these tools and techniques has a unique role, and you will learn to use them cooperatively to quickly and adaptively find the actual cause of performance issues. All of this will be illustrated through demonstrations that will teach you how to drill from high-level problem detection all the way to a specific spot in a query plan or deeper?pinpointing the exact problem and helping you quickly solve it. Attend this seminar to take full control of your databases—and never again stumble blindly through the dimly lit world of performance troubleshooting.

# Storage and Virtualization for DBAs
#### [Back to calendar](#id-27)
Event Date: 06-11-2013 09:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Denny Cherry
## Title: Storage and Virtualization for DBAs
## Description:
### This two-part seminar will focus on two of the biggest topics in the DBA field: how to properly design your SAN storage solution and how to properly design your virtualization solution. The storage portion of this workshop will focus on SAN storage, but most of the material will apply to direct attached storage as well.

We will begin by focusing on the storage array. Storage can be one of the biggest bottlenecks when it comes to database performance. It ís also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language. In the first half of this seminar, we will look at storage from both the database and storage perspectives. We will dig into LUNs, HBAs, and the fabric. Then we will examine advanced storage configurations, including RAID groups, multi-pathing software, and proper redundant storage network design. We will also cover some advanced storage array backup techniques, including taking storage level clones and snapshots, then see best practices for using them to back up the SQL Server environment to provide maximum redundancy with no recurring tape costs. In addition to theory, we will look at an actual SAN so we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.

In the second half of the day, we will explore the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment, when it is not be a good idea, and when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea and can save you some money. We will see how to gather the metrics you need to make the appropriate decision for your environment. We will also look at how to tie the virtual platforms to the storage array so that you can maximize the storage performance for your SQL Servers and the virtual environment.

# Enterprise Information Management with SQL Server 2012
#### [Back to calendar](#id-27)
Event Date: 06-11-2013 09:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development and Administration
## Speaker(s): Dejan Sarka
## Title: Enterprise Information Management with SQL Server 2012
## Description:
### Companies want to gather information from their data, so they start BI projects. They design a data warehouse and start developing extract – transform – load (ETL) applications. Then they discover they have data quality (DQ) issues. While poor data quality can cause problems in line-of-business applications, data quality can be a huge obstacle to a successful BI project.

Every company has "master data" - certain data that is used everywhere, in every transaction, such as customers data and products data. The people who manage master data are often called data stewards. Processes and activities for maintaining master data are known as master data management (MDM). In this workshop, we will discuss ETL, DQ, and MDM challenges and look at Microsoft SQL Server technologies and tools that can help you with solutions, including SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), Data Quality Services (DQS), and Master Data Services (MDS), and other tools for data profiling and matching. Workshop modules include:
1. Master Data and Master Data Management
2. Introduction to ETL with SQL Server Integration Services
3. Improving Data Quality with Data Quality Services
4. Managing Master Data with Master Data Services
5. Data Profiling in Depth
6. Identity Mapping and De-Duplicating

Event Date: 07-11-2013 09:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration and Deployment
## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: Why is SQL Server Slow Right Now?
## Description:
### You need a fast, easy way to troubleshoot temporary slowdowns on SQL Server 2005, 2008, and 2012. Before you open Task Manager or run sp_who2, join this session for a simple script to rapidly identify common culprits such as blocking queries, long-running jobs, and CPU spikes. You've used sp_Blitz to find out general problems with the SQL Server and you know it's not perfect, but why is it unusually slow RIGHT NOW? Let's tackle it together. When you get back to the office, you'll have: * An easy-to-use script to find bottlenecks fast * Instructions on how to let anybody run it without being SA * Fewer help desk tickets and phone calls pestering you

## Speaker(s): Dejan Sarka
## Title: Advanced Analytics in Excel 2013 
## Description:
### Excel is “The” analytical tool in Microsoft suite for advanced analysts. You can use it as a SQL Server Analysis Services client or as a standalone analytical engine. With Excel, you can analyze both, relational and unstructured big data. With PowerPivot, Excel becomes a single-user Analysis Services in tabular mode. The performance of your analytical processing is amazing. With Power View inside Excel, you can create ad-hoc reports on the tabular model with minimal effort. With Data Mining Add-in, you can perform even the most advanced analyzes on your Excel data. This session introduces Excel 2013 and 2010 business intelligence capabilities, and then focuses on the most advanced part, on data mining with Excel.

# SQL Server and XML Query
#### [Back to calendar](#id-27)
Event Date: 07-11-2013 09:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Matija Lah
## Title: SQL Server and XML Query
## Description:
### XML was added to the collection of SQL Server native data types in SQL Server 2005. Being a complex data type, not only is XML accompanied by a set of dedicated T-SQL functions, but also with a complete querying language. In this session you will learn about the Microsoft SQL Server 2008 implementation of the World Wide Web Consortium's XML Query Recommendation, and learn how to compose XML data – from existing SQL Server data or simply "from scratch", how to retrieve (relational) data from XML Documents to be used in a SQL Server database, and how to manipulate XML data using Transact-SQL and the XML Data Manipulation Language (XML DML). You've already mastered all the primitive SQL Server data types, why would XML be an exception?

## Speaker(s): Kennie Pontoppidan
## Title: SQL anti patterns
## Description:
### Antipatterns is a way of naming common design errors in order to make them easier to remember - even if you haven't done them yet. We will become acquainted with antipatterns on a physical level, a logical level and an sql-queries and application level, and spice it up with some seriously foolish errors made by me and my colleagues.

# Choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional
#### [Back to calendar](#id-27)
Event Date: 07-11-2013 12:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development and Administration
## Speaker(s): Hans Geurtsen
## Title: Choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional
## Description:
### OLAP functionality has been part of SQL Server ever since the introduction of OLAP Services in SQL Server 7. Considering the functionality already exists far more than a decade, Analysis Services is still not used as much as one would expect for a feature freely available to all SQL Server customers. One of the reasons why Microsoft added a new choice to Analysis Services which makes building and deploying it easier: tabular mode. In this session you will learn the differences between this new mode and the ‘old’ multidimensional mode. We will look at the BI Semantic Model, which is the foundation of both modes. We will also take a look under the hood to find the xVelocity Engine which makes tabular mode impressively fast. And of course you will see tabular mode in action and learn how easy it is to build a tabular mode Analysis Services database.

## Speaker(s): Alberto Ferrari
## Title: Optimizing Data Models in Tabular & PowerPivot
## Description:
### Is your new Tabular solution performing at its best? Are you using the best practices to reduce memory footprint, increase query speed and get the best out of the new engine? In this session, we will look at several techniques that can really make the difference in a Tabular solution. Distinct count reduction, join optimizations, condition consolidation, pros and cons of normalized data models, selection of the columns to store in the database are some of the topics covered in this session, which will highlight not only the best practices, but also practices that were best in Multidimensional and became worst in Tabular. As we are used to teach: if you known Multidimensional, you need to forget it in order to let the new concepts of Tabular shape your model.

## Speaker(s): Matija Lah
## Title: FILETABLEs: What They Are and How to Use Them
## Description:
### Have you ever had the need to access documents in your database as if they were files in the file system? SQL Server 2012 introduces a brand new method for managing large data objects (BLOBs) in a database. FILETABLEs provide access to data using Transact-SQL - just like any other table inside the database, while at the same time also provide access to the data using the operating system File I/O API - i.e. just like any other folder in the file system. In this session you will learn how to upgrade your document management solutions by migrating your large data to FILETABLEs. The session covers two most typical migration scenarios: migrating from a distributed data store, where files are stored outside the database, and from a homogeneous data store where large objects are stored in tables.

## Speaker(s): Adam Machanic
## Title: Data, Faster: SQL Server Performance Techniques with SQLCLR
## Description:
### Sometimes it seems like business users are constantly more demanding: They want more data, more analytics, more insight, and the output needs to be faster, faster, faster. And so we database developers struggle to write ever more complex queries, tune our hardware, carefully choose indexes...and sometimes it’s just not enough. Where do you go when you’ve hit the performance wall? As more and more developers are discovering, a great choice is to make use of SQL Server’s CLR capabilities. User-defined aggregates, table valued functions, and user-defined types are more than just logical constructs; properly applied, they can make complex, logic-driven queries many times faster. This session will show you when and how to use these powerful tools in ways you may not have previously considered. If you’re ready to take your SQL Server development skills to the next level, this session is definitely your starting point.

## Speaker(s): Neil Hambly
## Title: Load Testing with SQL Server Tools
## Description:
### It’s often difficult to know how your SQL Servers will perform under different loads. By performing load testing, we can gain these key insights, perform modifications to existing configurations, and understand the impact on performance levels.

Come learn about the native tools at our disposal for performing these important load tests and how we can identify when performance levels begin to drop. Using demos of these native tools – including Distributed Replay Utility (DRU), Database Tuning Adviser (DTA), Perfmon, Extended Events, and Profiler – we’ll see how to plan and perform a load test project, gain an understanding of SQL Server’s performance under varying load scenarios, and discover which tell-tale indicators can help alert us to performance degradation.

## Title: Analysing Data with Power View
## Description:
### Power View is Microsoft's Data Visualisation tool, and is used to analyse data. Using demos, we learn about using Power View to analyse data, whilst assessing it based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles by luminaries such as Stephen Few, Tufte and others. We will: - investigate Power View based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles - examine how data can be analysed with Power View - look at where Power View is supplemented by other parts of the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack Come to this session if you really want to think about the best ways of presenting data to your Business Intelligence data consumers, and see how to apply these principles in Power View.

## Title: Index Impact Workload Analysis
## Description:
### Index Impact Workload Analysis
==============================
Should we add this additional index, should we modify existing ones, or does it make sense to drop unused (?) indexes to improve workload performance? A lot of different questions, but finding correct, profound answers is very hard and difficult. In this session you will learn a proven approach how you can identify if an index change was a good or bad one. We will take a real SQL Server OLTP workload, establish a baseline against it, and use that baseline together with some tools to determine if index changes should be applied to our production databases, or not. After attending this session, it is very easy for you to apply the same techniques to your production environment.

# Automating DWH Patterns through Metadata
#### [Back to calendar](#id-27)
Event Date: 08-11-2013 10:30 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development and Administration
## Speaker(s): Davide Mauri
## Title: Automating DWH Patterns through Metadata
## Description:
### Something around 80% of the work of a BI solution is spent building the ETL phase. ETL is also usually a quite big challenge, but it can be easily broken down into two - at least - separated processes. One is strictly related to business modeling, and therefore cannot be replicated by definition. The other one is a purely technical processes, always the same regardless of the reality in which we operate, and as so can then be deeply automated. In this session we will look at the well-known patterns to solve common problems and how they can automated, with the help of specific tools and techniques that utilizes metadata in order to reduce development time and bugs to a minimum. The presented engineered will enable the adoption on an Agile approach to your BI solution.

# Estimation and Statistics : The basis of query optimization
#### [Back to calendar](#id-27)
Event Date: 08-11-2013 10:30 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Dave Ballantyne
## Title: Estimation and Statistics : The basis of query optimization
## Description:
### At the heart of SQL Server is the cost based optimizer. Stop and think about that a minute, it attempts to give the “best plan” based on the cost of the work undertaken. How does it know the cost of the work before its done the work ? This isn’t a conundrum, it doesn’t. It estimates! How does it estimate ? That is statistics. This will be a deep dive into how the optimizer makes its decisions to give you a plan, the things that can go wrong and how you can have influence over these choices.

## Speaker(s): Constantin Klein
## Title: StreamInsight: Complex Event Processing by MS
## Description:
### The number of sensors is growing and growing and brings us closer to the "Internet of things". Applications, that have to process a big amount of data from event streams are a logical consequence. Some developers might have heard from Reactive Extensions (Rx) already, but Microsoft offers with StreamInsight (SI) another comprehensive platform for these scenarios. In this session you will learn what a great addition for your toolbox StreamInsight is, if you have to develop applications, that have to handle complex events (CEP- Complex Event Processing). See how you can start with this technologie and how easy it is to jump in for .NET developers.

# Using Your Brain to Beat SQL Server

Event Date: 08-11-2013 10:30 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Adam Machanic, Thomas Kejser
## Title: Using Your Brain to Beat SQL Server
## Description:
### Thought you did everything right? Indexes are finely tuned. Statistics are fully scanned and updated. Your nice big server seems to have plenty of power. But you are still not getting the performance you expect from SQL Server. Why is the optimiser failing you?

SQL Server's query optimizer, often very good at coming up with decently-performing plans, also regularly goes down the wrong path. The problem domain is simply too large and complex for it to adequately cover all cases. When the going gets tough, you mind is a better machine for the job. So don't trust optimisation to a mere piece of code! In this session we will teach you how to recognise various real world cases where the optimiser fails. We will show you why these queries aren't performing as well as they should and how to work around the optimiser's lack of insight. You will learn to turn your brain into a better query optimiser and make your queries faster than you thought possible.

## Speaker(s): Lord Richard Douglas
## Title: The Day After Tomorrow: Why you need to baseline
## Description:
### Ensuring peak SQL Server performance isn’t always easy and requires a lot of work on the part of the DBA. To maintain the best-possible performance, you need to make sure you’re monitoring the right things. But how do you know if the figures you’re seeing are good or bad? Baseline comparisons can help, and in this educational session, SQL Server expert Richard Douglas will show you how to get the most from them. Richard will explain what a baseline is, why and when you need to take one, and how you can create one. You’ll also learn about a number of native Windows and SQL Server tools that will allow you to do just that.

## Speaker(s): Christina Leo
## Title: The Secret Life of APPLY: Helping Us Work Smarter, Not Harder
## Description:
### At the very least, a T-SQL developer should know that the APPLY operator lets you access data from a table-valued function in a dynamic manner. But why stop there? When getting the data you need requires going around your elbow to get to your nose, that's when the savvy developer remembers the APPLY operator can be used with any table expression. Have you ever wished you could get multiple columns or multiple rows from a correlated sub-query? What about needing to UNPIVOT a data set, or parse some XML code? Have you simply wanted to find a way to handle complex calculations without having to cut and paste the entire formula in the WHERE or GROUP BY clause? This all-demo session answers those needs by revealing the secret life of APPLY, and helping you count yourself among those ace developers that use this handy operator to work smarter, not harder.

## Speaker(s): Menzo Steinhorst
## Title: Reading Query Plans 
## Description:
### T-SQL is a declarative language. We tell SQL Server what needs to be done, not how to do it. That’s where query plans come in: they tell us how SQL Server executed our queries. And that can be very interesting! This session will be based on real-world scenarios. We will have a look at common operators and check whether they were good or bad. And in which situations those operators are bad. I’ll also show how to change the plan with indexes, statistics and hints.

## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: How the SQL Server Engine Thinks
## Description:
### When you pass in a query, how does SQL Server build the results? We'll role play: Brent Ozar will be an end user sending in queries, and you'll be the SQL Server engine. Using simple spreadsheets as your tables, you'll learn how SQL Server builds execution plans, uses indexes, performs joins, and considers statistics. This session is for DBAs and developers who are comfortable writing queries, but not so comfortable when it comes to explaining nonclustered indexes, lookups, and sargability.
