## Speaker(s): Alex Whittles
## Title: Beginners Guide to MDX
## Description:
### Give your queries a multidimensional makeover. In this session we'll look at the structure and basics of MDX, the Multi Dimensional query eXpression language for querying Analysis Services OLAP cubes.

MDX can seem daunting, but when broken down into the basics, it's easier than you think. We'll start at the beginning, so you need no previous MDX experience, but it does help to have some experience with cubes. If you already write MDX but struggle with the syntax, then you need to attend this session!

The session walks through the difference between a member, measure, tuple, set, and dimension. We describe how to decipher a [] from a {} or a (), and we look at some of the awesome power that MDX can provide to your reporting.

#### [Back to calendar](#id-531)
Event Date: 17-09-2015 15:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Amit Banerjee, Sourabh Agarwal
## Title: How to be a Ninja: Troubleshooting SQL performance on Azure Virtual Machines
## Description:
### Troubleshooting is an art but the tricks of the trade changed with the advent of Azure Virtual Machines. Performance troubleshooting is different and at the same time very similar to what you have been used to for SQL Server. SQL Server performance on Azure VMs can be a sore point for many as the host troubleshooting entry points are limited and the knowledge of the internal workings scarce. 
 
In this session, we will show you what best practices should be known for SQL Server instances running on Azure Virtual Machines! We will talk about tips on automating the implementation of all these best practices during deployment making this a single one-click deployment. This session will be a pre-cursor to our pre-con where we will go the whole nine yards and detail how to automate deployments from scratch, implement best practices automatically and analyze performance issues magically!

# Building Better SSIS Packages
#### [Back to calendar](#id-531)
Event Date: 17-09-2015 16:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Tim Mitchell
## Title: Building Better SSIS Packages
## Description:
### Building packages in SQL Server Integration Services is easy. Building good packages takes a bit more effort.

SQL Server Integration Services is deceptively easy to use. With a few hours of instruction or self-study, most data professionals can throw together an SSIS package. However, creating a process that simply runs successfully isn’t the endgame; enterprise-class ETL demands a higher standard. Specifically, well-designed packages will be:
• Reliable
• Resilient
• Reusable
• Maintainable
• Well performing

There’s nothing magical about building rock-solid SSIS packages, but it does take some discipline, experience, and a library of best practices. That is exactly the aim of this course: to demonstrate a set of proven practices that help frame the development of enterprise-ready SSIS packages.

In this preview of my full-day presentation, we will walk through each of these five facets of well-built packages, discussing and then demonstrating ways of applying these practices to design better SSIS packages. Among the topics for the day:
• Checking for problems even when the package executes successfully
• Building effective tests for your packages
• Error handling and prevention
• Being kind to your fellow developers by building  clear and easy-to-maintain packages
• Leave a trail of evidence: package logging done properly
• Avoiding performance bottlenecks: tips for making packages run faster
• Using the right tool for the job by integrating non-SSIS tools when appropriate

## Speaker(s): Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: SQL Server Internals: The Practical Angle - Sneak Peek
## Description:
### A deep understanding of SQL Server internals makes it much easier to design and maintain efficient SQL Server solutions. Unfortunately, database professionals who lack this knowledge often make design and implementation decisions that adversely affect their systems.

“SQL Server Internals: The Practical Angle” pre-con helps to address these issues. It shows how SQL Server components work under the hood and how it affects your systems. It is for database professionals who want to get the most from SQL Server.

In this session, Dmitri provides an overview of the pre-con and gives you a sneak peek of the several topics it covers:
- Performance impact of the forwarding pointers in heap tables
- Triggers and index fragmentation
- Lock Escalation
- Plan caching and Parameter Sniffing

#### [Back to calendar](#id-531)
Event Date: 17-09-2015 19:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker(s): Russ Thomas
## Title: Stress Inoculation: Maintaining Performance Under Pressure
## Description:
### Stress is a natural reaction to demanding events for which our natural resources to cope or react are low. Initial effects might be increased energy and focus but can quickly give way to inaction and costly mistakes. 

This course presents a variety of simple yet highly actionable techniques borrowed from some of the most stressful fields on earth. In this course, you learn to apply the same methods that doctors, military, law enforcement, and paramedics learn to cope and perform under high-stress situations. Discover how easily these techniques translate to almost any career or endeavor.  

Whether you regularly support a multi-million dollar data center on a 24-hour on-call rotation or are asked to restore production while three levels of management look over your shoulder, counting the dollars lost per minute, everyone is susceptible to stress. Some people just have a higher immunity. Attend this inoculation session and get caught up on your boosters.

# Hacking Exposé Too: Just How Transparent is TDE?
#### [Back to calendar](#id-531)
Event Date: 17-09-2015 21:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Chris Bell
## Title: Hacking Exposé Too: Just How Transparent is TDE?
## Description:
### You need to be compliant but can’t change source code or SQL code. What’s your option? Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), of course! 
The real question, though, is just how transparent is TDE?

In this second installment of the Hacking Exposé series, we assume the role of a hacker, dig into our database, and steal your backups and data files. Next, we try to restore the files, and even dig into the files themselves and see what might be exposed.

We then go through the steps to lock down your data using TDE.
Once again, we assume the role of a hacker and try to dig through the database, steal backups and data files, and see what is available to us.

*Warning: Do not try these demos at work without proper permissions, as some actual hacking techniques are used.

## Speaker(s): Stacia Varga
## Title: Visualizing Data: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
## Description:
### The Microsoft BI stack provides an assortment of data visualization tools, but do you know how to use these tools effectively to communicate information clearly? In this preview of my preconference workshop, you learn about the vocabulary of visualization as we explore one of the four categories of visualizations that I'll explain in the preconference session. For this selected category, we'll see how misuse of this type of visualizations can distort your data and how to correct it by selecting the right tool and applying the appropriate design. Last, we 'll compare and contrast the options available among the Microsoft BI toolset for working with this type of visualization so that you have a better understanding of the available options so you can decide which of these tools best support your own visualization requirements.

## Speaker(s): Paul Turley
## Title: Upgrade and Migration Planning BI Features for SQL Server 2014 and 2016
## Description:
### An upgrade and/or migration is far more than just a case of moving a database or installing a new version of SQL Server. This preview of my PASS Summit pre-conference session will guide you through the process, looking at not only the technology but the methodology, processes and tools that we have at our disposal to make a successful move to more current versions on premises, in the cloud, or both with SQL Server in an Azure VM or Azure SQL Database. We will touch on workload-specific upgrade needs for OLTP, HA, SSAS/SSRS, and SSIS environments. For those impacted by the end of extended support for SQL Server 2005 on 04/12/2016, we will discuss enhancements to the SQL Server platform and examples of how to take advantage of the latest features.

#### [Back to calendar](#id-531)
Event Date: 18-09-2015 02:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Professional Development
## Speaker(s): Mike Hillwig
## Title: Leadership Without Borders: Working with Global Teams
## Description:
### As companies become more global, IT teams need to adapt. This often means having resources in locations outside our home countries as well as hiring outside parties for staff augmentation. As we place people in locations outside our own walls, processes and practices need to keep up with this shift. Whether your people are in Boston, Berlin, Bangalore, or Beijing, they all need to work together. We look at the challenges of having a globally diverse team, including collaboration, feedback, work assignments, and performance evaluations. We also look at outsourcing, offshoring, and a combination of the two. And we look at one of the greatest benefits: follow-the-sun support. In this session, we demonstrate how a language barrier isn't usually the biggest challenge and how cultural differences make the most impact.

# Highlights From Index Internals: RowStore, ColumnStore, and NoStore!
#### [Back to calendar](#id-531)
Event Date: 18-09-2015 03:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Highlights From Index Internals: RowStore, ColumnStore, and NoStore!
## Description:
### Indexes allow SQL Server to access your data in the most efficient manner. Indexes are the only tuning technique that can improve query performance by orders of magnitude. Understanding exactly how your indexes are structured can enable you to choose the best indexes for your queries. SQL Server 2014 provides three very different kinds of index structures: traditional B-tree clustered and nonclustered indexes, ColumnStore clustered and nonclustered indexes, and in-memory indexes that are used for memory-optimized tables. In this preview of my PASS Summit session, we take a brief look at how each of these three types of indexes is stored and used. For B-tree indexes, we look at the difference between clustered and nonclustered indexes, and we explore fragmentation and defragmentation. For ColumnStore indexes, we see how they are stored differently than B-tree row-based indexes, and we compare SQL Server 2012 nonclustered indexes with SQL Server 2014 clustered ColumnStores. For in-memory online transaction processing (OLTP) indexes, we see yet another way of managing indexes. Because indexes for memory-optimized tables are not stored on disk (hence the NoStore reference), we talk about how they can be persisted across SQL Server restarts. For each type, we also cover some best practice recommendations. Knowing how indexes are useful and how each type is stored and managed can enable you to compare them and to decide which index type is the best choice for your needs.

## Speaker(s): Sean McCown
## Title: The Enterprise Scripting Workshop
## Description:
### The database administrator (DBA) life can be frustrating: You rarely have time to innovate because the same tasks fill up your time day after day. Your users are unhappy about how long it takes to resolve “simple” tickets. You need to put big items on hold to manage special requests. As careful as you are, mistakes creep in the busier you get. 

This is a preview of the PASS Summit pre-conference session. In the pre-conference workshop, learn how to develop enterprise scripts with a huge range of uses. A good set of reusable scripts can reduce task time from hours or days to just a few minutes, and eliminate mistakes from your environment.• Enterprise philosophy: Tackle simple tasks with the whole environment in mind.
• Single data store: Define the benefits and uses of a single central database for common-use data and metadata.
• Choice of tools: Choose the best tool (e.g., PowerShell, T-SQL, SSIS) for the job.
• Environment ground work: Prepare your environment for enterprise scripting.
• Real-world scripts: Work through dozens of enterprise scripting issues (e.g., alerting, error handling, multiple SQL versions) as you develop a real enterprise script in class 

This session is for DBAs with a basic understanding of PowerShell. It’s for anyone who touches backups or security, maintains databases, troubleshoots performance, monitors disk space, or any of a hundred other DBA tasks. Enterprise scripting is for anyone who has more tasks than time.

## Speaker(s): Allan Mitchell
## Title: Building a Scalable Analytical Solution Using IaaS and Elasticsearch
## Description:
### This session is a teaser to my half day session at this year's PASS Summit in Seattle.  The cloud has really changed the way we architect solutions.  A key enabler for the cloud is the ability to take your on-premise solution and lift it to the cloud with very little change.  Once in the cloud you get all the goodness of scale and management.

My session is going to show you how to take a non Microsoft product (Elasticsearch) and move it into the Microsoft cloud.  I will show you how to do this with a repeatable and measurable process.  

Elasticsearch is a distributed restful search and analytics application. It is document oriented, schema free, and based on the Lucene search engine. Not content with being a free text search engine, Elasticsearch lets you perform real-time analytics over your data as well.  Along with SolR it is at the forefront of text analytics and is used the world over.

Finally I will show you some visualisations in Kibana.  Kibana allows you to create time-based comparisons over your data and gives the users power to derive insight from the data.

Remember this session is a teaser.  Come to the real session in Seattle to get a much deeper insight.

## Speaker(s): John Welch
## Title: Advanced Scripting Using SSIS Script Tasks and Components
## Description:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) offers significant capabilities out of the box. However, many data movement projects have needs that go above and beyond common scenarios. Have you ever needed to calculate running totals during your ETL process? What about using dynamically updated business rules during processing to determine which data is valid? These things, and many more, can be accomplished by using the script task and component within SSIS.

## Title: Integrating SQL Server Analysis Services with Hadoop
## Description:
### Although Hadoop is designed for scalability with massive amounts of data, it is inherently slow. This makes ad hoc analysis prohibitive because of slow query performance. To address this issue, you can bring Hadoop data into SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). This session looks at how to integrate SQL SSAS with Hadoop to provide real-time data analysis and reporting. You learn about the Hadoop ecosystem and architecture, how to integrate Hadoop with SSAS, and how to take advantage of the Hadoop-SSAS combination to provide a data analysis platform for your business.
