Event Date: 17-09-2015 12:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Alex Whittles
## Title: Beginners Guide to MDX
## Description:
### Give your queries a multidimensional makeover. In this session we'll look at the structure and basics of MDX, the Multi Dimensional query eXpression language for querying Analysis Services OLAP cubes.

MDX can seem daunting, but when broken down into the basics, it's easier than you think. We'll start at the beginning, so you need no previous MDX experience, but it does help to have some experience with cubes. If you already write MDX but struggle with the syntax, then you need to attend this session!

The session walks through the difference between a member, measure, tuple, set, and dimension. We describe how to decipher a [] from a {} or a (), and we look at some of the awesome power that MDX can provide to your reporting.

## Speaker(s): Tim Mitchell
## Title: Building Better SSIS Packages
## Description:
### Building packages in SQL Server Integration Services is easy. Building good packages takes a bit more effort.

SQL Server Integration Services is deceptively easy to use. With a few hours of instruction or self-study, most data professionals can throw together an SSIS package. However, creating a process that simply runs successfully isn’t the endgame; enterprise-class ETL demands a higher standard. Specifically, well-designed packages will be:
• Reliable
• Resilient
• Reusable
• Maintainable
• Well performing

There’s nothing magical about building rock-solid SSIS packages, but it does take some discipline, experience, and a library of best practices. That is exactly the aim of this course: to demonstrate a set of proven practices that help frame the development of enterprise-ready SSIS packages.

In this preview of my full-day presentation, we will walk through each of these five facets of well-built packages, discussing and then demonstrating ways of applying these practices to design better SSIS packages. Among the topics for the day:
• Checking for problems even when the package executes successfully
• Building effective tests for your packages
• Error handling and prevention
• Being kind to your fellow developers by building  clear and easy-to-maintain packages
• Leave a trail of evidence: package logging done properly
• Avoiding performance bottlenecks: tips for making packages run faster
• Using the right tool for the job by integrating non-SSIS tools when appropriate

## Speaker(s): Russ Thomas
## Title: Stress Inoculation: Maintaining Performance Under Pressure
## Description:
### Stress is a natural reaction to demanding events for which our natural resources to cope or react are low. Initial effects might be increased energy and focus but can quickly give way to inaction and costly mistakes. 

This course presents a variety of simple yet highly actionable techniques borrowed from some of the most stressful fields on earth. In this course, you learn to apply the same methods that doctors, military, law enforcement, and paramedics learn to cope and perform under high-stress situations. Discover how easily these techniques translate to almost any career or endeavor.  

Whether you regularly support a multi-million dollar data center on a 24-hour on-call rotation or are asked to restore production while three levels of management look over your shoulder, counting the dollars lost per minute, everyone is susceptible to stress. Some people just have a higher immunity. Attend this inoculation session and get caught up on your boosters.

## Speaker(s): Stacia Varga
## Title: Visualizing Data: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
## Description:
### The Microsoft BI stack provides an assortment of data visualization tools, but do you know how to use these tools effectively to communicate information clearly? In this preview of my preconference workshop, you learn about the vocabulary of visualization as we explore one of the four categories of visualizations that I'll explain in the preconference session. For this selected category, we'll see how misuse of this type of visualizations can distort your data and how to correct it by selecting the right tool and applying the appropriate design. Last, we 'll compare and contrast the options available among the Microsoft BI toolset for working with this type of visualization so that you have a better understanding of the available options so you can decide which of these tools best support your own visualization requirements.

## Speaker(s): Paul Turley
## Title: Upgrade and Migration Planning BI Features for SQL Server 2014 and 2016
## Description:
### An upgrade and/or migration is far more than just a case of moving a database or installing a new version of SQL Server. This preview of my PASS Summit pre-conference session will guide you through the process, looking at not only the technology but the methodology, processes and tools that we have at our disposal to make a successful move to more current versions on premises, in the cloud, or both with SQL Server in an Azure VM or Azure SQL Database. We will touch on workload-specific upgrade needs for OLTP, HA, SSAS/SSRS, and SSIS environments. For those impacted by the end of extended support for SQL Server 2005 on 04/12/2016, we will discuss enhancements to the SQL Server platform and examples of how to take advantage of the latest features.

## Speaker(s): Sean McCown
## Title: The Enterprise Scripting Workshop
## Description:
### The database administrator (DBA) life can be frustrating: You rarely have time to innovate because the same tasks fill up your time day after day. Your users are unhappy about how long it takes to resolve “simple” tickets. You need to put big items on hold to manage special requests. As careful as you are, mistakes creep in the busier you get. 

This is a preview of the PASS Summit pre-conference session. In the pre-conference workshop, learn how to develop enterprise scripts with a huge range of uses. A good set of reusable scripts can reduce task time from hours or days to just a few minutes, and eliminate mistakes from your environment.• Enterprise philosophy: Tackle simple tasks with the whole environment in mind.
• Single data store: Define the benefits and uses of a single central database for common-use data and metadata.
• Choice of tools: Choose the best tool (e.g., PowerShell, T-SQL, SSIS) for the job.
• Environment ground work: Prepare your environment for enterprise scripting.
• Real-world scripts: Work through dozens of enterprise scripting issues (e.g., alerting, error handling, multiple SQL versions) as you develop a real enterprise script in class 

This session is for DBAs with a basic understanding of PowerShell. It’s for anyone who touches backups or security, maintains databases, troubleshoots performance, monitors disk space, or any of a hundred other DBA tasks. Enterprise scripting is for anyone who has more tasks than time.

## Speaker(s): John Welch
## Title: Advanced Scripting Using SSIS Script Tasks and Components
## Description:
### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) offers significant capabilities out of the box. However, many data movement projects have needs that go above and beyond common scenarios. Have you ever needed to calculate running totals during your ETL process? What about using dynamically updated business rules during processing to determine which data is valid? These things, and many more, can be accomplished by using the script task and component within SSIS. This session demonstrates several scripts in SSIS that show how to take full advantage of the capabilities of SSIS. This session is intended for people who have worked with and understand SSIS and have a basic understanding of .NET development.

## Speaker(s): Edwin M Sarmiento
## Title: Integrating SQL Server Analysis Services with Hadoop
## Description:
### Although Hadoop is designed for scalability with massive amounts of data, it is inherently slow. This makes ad hoc analysis prohibitive because of slow query performance. To address this issue, you can bring Hadoop data into SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). This session looks at how to integrate SQL SSAS with Hadoop to provide real-time data analysis and reporting. You learn about the Hadoop ecosystem and architecture, how to integrate Hadoop with SSAS, and how to take advantage of the Hadoop-SSAS combination to provide a data analysis platform for your business.
