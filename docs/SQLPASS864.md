## Title: Leading the Industry: Expert Insights on GDPR
## Description:
### Join Alice Kupcik and James Murtagh for the keynote kick-off to 4 back-to-back sessions focused on GDPR and what it means for you and your team.

GDPR for the SQL Team - Introduction and Case Study
Alice Kupcik, Senior Program Manager - Azure SQL Database at Microsoft will give an overview of her experience approaching GDPR for the SQL team. In 30 minutes she will provide an introduction to GDPR and a case study of her team's experience.

Is the GDPR a Bitter Pill, or a Welcome Remedy?
James Murtagh, Product Marketing Manager at Redgate, provides an overview of The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the latest law to put a spotlight on personal information. Driven by the impending May 25 enforcement day, the whole subject of how data is collected, stored and processed has moved from the backroom to the boardroom. But here’s a thought: could it be good for organizations and companies rather than an unwelcome diversion? In this 30 minute session you’ll learn about the requirements the GDPR places on SQL Server teams, and why the regulation should be embraced by all, not just those aiming to avoid a fine.

## Speaker(s): Richard Macaskill
## Title: “Show me, don’t just tell me!” Data Mapping for a New Era of Oversight.
## Description:
### Protecting data can be difficult. With data often spread across a growing number of different environments, it's hard to know what to restrict and where it's located. This risks non-compliance, and leaves organizations open to data breaches. Article 30 of the GDPR (Records of processing activities), requires organisations to not just “maintain a record of processing activities…” but also to “make the record available to the supervisory authority on request.” But it doesn’t tell you how. In this session you’ll learn about practical steps you can take to create a durable and living record of what you hold in your SQL estate.

## Speaker(s): Jose Chinchilla
## Title: The New Rules of SQL Server Monitoring
## Description:
### If the regulatory requirements for data and data management in the GDPR weren’t enough incentive to put more monitoring and protection in place, the ever expanding number of data breaches should be. You’re not only required to monitor your systems for GDPR compliance, you need to monitor your systems for all possible issues. This session will introduce methods and mechanisms that enable you to minimize the risk of losing availability. This knowledge will help you ensure that you can meet the new and challenging requirements of the GDPR and our modern security environment.

## Speaker(s): Steve Jones
## Title: Not Just for Europe: The Global Impact of the GDPR
## Description:
### When the GDPR legislation takes effect in May, will you be prepared? Do you need to be ready? Many of us live outside of the EU and may not think that we need to change any of our processes or practices. But the GDPR applies globally to all organizations holding EU citizens' data. Furthermore, the principles of the GDPR are the principles of good data protection and many data professionals have advocated for similar practices in the past. In this session you’ll learn how the GDPR impacts businesses across the globe, and how you can use the guidelines it sets out to not only become better prepared but also reduce risk across your data estate.
