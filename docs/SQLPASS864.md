## Speaker(s): Richard Macaskill
## Title: “Show me, don’t just tell me!” Data Mapping for a New Era of Oversight.
## Description:
### Protecting data can be difficult. With data often spread across a growing number of different environments, it's hard to know what to restrict and where it's located. This risks non-compliance, and leaves organizations open to data breaches. Article 30 of the GDPR (Records of processing activities), requires organisations to not just “maintain a record of processing activities…” but also to “make the record available to the supervisory authority on request.” But it doesn’t tell you how. In this session you’ll learn about practical steps you can take to create a durable and living record of what you hold in your SQL estate.

## Speaker(s): Jose Chinchilla
## Title: The New Rules of SQL Server Monitoring
## Description:
### If the regulatory requirements for data and data management in the GDPR weren’t enough incentive to put more monitoring and protection in place, the ever expanding number of data breaches should be. You’re not only required to monitor your systems for GDPR compliance, you need to monitor your systems for all possible issues. This session will introduce methods and mechanisms that enable you to minimize the risk of losing availability. This knowledge will help you ensure that you can meet the new and challenging requirements of the GDPR and our modern security environment.
