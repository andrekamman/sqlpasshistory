## Speaker(s): Jason HALL
## Title: Are Open Source Databases on Your Radar?
## Description:
### As a SQL Server DBA, your role is changing. Many DBAs today are being asked to go beyond SQL Server and Oracle and manage open source and non-relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Cassandra. While these systems come with the same set of challenges most DBAs are used to like ensuring availability, diagnosing performance problems and monitoring capacity, each database platform has its own set of processes and workflows for collecting and analyzing data. 
In this session, you'll learn how you can centrally monitor, diagnose and report on open source databases in a single pane of glass, which includes coverage of your SQL Server, Oracle and DB2 deployments. 

You'll see how to easily: 
•	Centralize visibility into the health and status of MySQL (including MariaDB), PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Cassandra. 
•	Set up and receive alerts for critical problems in your database environment. 
•	Diagnose both real-time and historical performance problems. 
•	Dig into poor performing queries. 
•	Report on database availability and health. 
•	Improve database performance monitoring and open source database management.

# Git: Concepts & Strategies
#### [Back to calendar](#id-914)
Event Date: 12-06-2018 16:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Application Development
## Speaker(s): Lyndsey Padget
## Title: Git: Concepts & Strategies
## Description:
### Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know that Git is the most popular source control management in development shops today.  And for good reason; its power overshadows tools you may have used in the past, such as Subversion or Team Foundation Server.  While most developers and companies know this, making the switch can be painful.  It’s all too common to lose code or introduce bugs because of difficulties merging or resolving conflicts.  Even if you're already using it and comfortable with the basics, situations can arise where you wish you understood it better.
 
Whether you're writing code or managing developers who do, this course is for you.  This session will cover the most critical git concepts, basic and advanced, in a completely visualized way.  At the same time, you’ll pick up git terminal commands to help you understand (or even eliminate) a git GUI you already use.  Go beyond the basics to learn how to get yourself out of a git pickle, practical release management strategies, and more.

# Why is that Data Wrong? How Choosing the Wrong Isolation Level Causes Bad Results
#### [Back to calendar](#id-914)
Event Date: 12-06-2018 19:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Kendra Little
## Title: Why is that Data Wrong? How Choosing the Wrong Isolation Level Causes Bad Results
## Description:
### If you haven't thought much about isolation levels in SQL Server, chances are your applications can return inconsistent data to your users: data that looks completely wrong. If your user reruns their report or reloads their screen, the data may look right the second time -- but after this happens, your customer feels that they can’t trust your data.

In this session, you will learn what "isolation levels" are and how the read committed isolation level works by default in SQL Server. You'll see how easy it is to make a query return inconsistent results using these default settings, and why this is allowed to happen. We'll dig into an example where blocking causes a query to return "impossible" query results. You'll leave the session with a fresh understanding of why choosing the right isolation level is critical to the success of your applications.

# Least Privilege, Greatest Privacy
#### [Back to calendar](#id-914)
Event Date: 13-06-2018 03:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Application Development
## Speaker(s): Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Least Privilege, Greatest Privacy
## Description:
### A key tenet of the new European GDPR is the idea that privacy should be a factor in all IT systems, new or old. This is not a new requirement - other data protection regulations have had similar goals over the years - but it has gained a new sense of urgency because of the GDPR's wide reach and strong penalties. The message is clear: we, as custodians of our companies' and our customers' data, need to do a better job of protecting our data.

Enter the Principle of Least Privilege - a simple yet powerful rule for determining what permissions an account needs. When coupled with SQL Server's permission model, it can be used to create a robust security model that satisfies whatever regulations your company requires. This session will be a high-level introduction to the concept and how it applies to data privacy. Join me at this year's PASS Summit for a more detailed look at how to apply permissions for maximum effect.
