# Don't Repeat Yourself - An Introduction to Agile SSIS Development
#### [Back to calendar](#id-462)
Event Date: 25-06-2015 10:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Cathrine Wilhelmsen
## Title: Don't Repeat Yourself - An Introduction to Agile SSIS Development
## Description:
### SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) is a powerful tool for extracting, transforming and loading data, but creating and maintaining a large number of SSIS packages can be both tedious and time-consuming. Even if you use templates and follow best practices you often have to repeat the same steps over and over again. Handling metadata and schema changes is a manual process, and there are no easy ways to implement new requirements in multiple packages at the same time.

It is time to bring the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) software engineering principle to SSIS projects. First learn how to use Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) and BimlScript to generate SSIS packages from database metadata and implement changes in all those packages with just a few clicks. Then take the DRY principle one step further and learn how to update all packages in multiple projects by separating and reusing common code. See how Biml allows you to complete in a day what once took more than a week!

## Title: The Data Loading Performance Presentation
## Description:
### Loading huge amounts of data into SQL Server can be a challenging task. When doing it, there are quite a few factors that can help or hurt you.

For that, Microsoft has published a famous whitepaper called "The Data Loading Performance Guide".
The problem is that it's long and full of small details, and we're too lazy to read it.

On this session, we will turn the whitepaper into a presentation and talk about the ways you can optimize your massive data loading processes by applying the techniques mentioned in the whitepaper, as well as other advanced techniques that have emerged since the whitepaper was published.

Among other topics, we will talk about the #1 enemy of high performance data loading, Minimal Logging and Bulk Load, indexing techniques, properly leveraging parallelism and partitioning, SQL Server 2014 Delayed Durability, and more.
