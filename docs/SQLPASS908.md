## Speaker(s): Jen Stirrup
## Title: Deep Learning in Microsoft Azure: CNTK, CaffeOnSpark and Tensorflow
## Description:
### What is Microsoft's approach to Deep Learning, and how does it differ from Open Source alternatives? In this session, we will look at Deep Learning, and how it can be implemented in Microsoft and Azure technologies with the Cognitive Toolkit, Tensorflow in Azure and CaffeOnSpark on AzureHDInsight. Join this session in order to understand deep learning better, and how we can use it to provide business and technical benefits in our organizations.

## Speaker(s): Leila Etaati
## Title: Machine Learning with SQL Server 2016 and 2017
## Description:
### Machine Learning helps developers, Business Analysis to create smart reports and applications. There is a way to leverage the machine learning inside Microsoft SQL Server 2016 and 2017 using two popular machine learning language (R and Python). In this session, I will show how to set up SQL Server 2016 (R services) and 2017 (ML Services) to write R or Python codes. Moreover, a brief discussion of packages that have been recommended by Microsoft to use such as Revoscale and AzureML will be provided to the audience. In addition, a best practice for doing machine learning such as installing desired R packages, create a training model first by exporting the data from SQL Server into Rstudio, after be sure the model works in R studio environment, then copy back the R code  into SQL Server stored procedure to create a machine learning model, store the model and use it for further model evaluation, or prediction. All these steps will be explained. Finally, a brief explanation on how we can create a chart and embed it into SQL Server Reporting Services will be delivered. All the explanations will be shown by a proper demo.
