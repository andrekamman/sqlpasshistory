## Title: Hardware 301: Selecting and Sizing Database Hardware for OLTP Performance
## Description:
### The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions.     Unfortunately, the DBA usually gets the blame for any performance issues that crop up later. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD and gives you the tools and resources to make better hardware selection decisions to support SQL Server OLTP workloads.

## Speaker(s): John Welch
## Title: Do You Know the Data Flow?
## Description:
### The Data Flow task is one of the most powerful and most complex tools available in SSIS. Whether you are brand new to SSIS, or you’ve been using it for a while, it’s likely you’ve had some questions about the Data Flow. Why are some components so much slower than others? Why can’t I store a value (like a row count) in one component, and use it in another component later in the Data Flow? And why does it always seem to be the part of my package that fails when I run it against real data? Well, you’re not alone. During this session, we’ll answer these questions (and many others) by learning how the Data Flow operates internally. We’ll cover the Data Flow from the basic (what’s a component?) to the advanced (how can I determine how many threads my Data Flow is using?). After attending this session, you’ll know a lot more about getting the most out of Data Flows in SSIS.

## Speaker(s): 
## Title: SQL SERVER 2008 / R2 - TROUBLESHOOTING SQL SERVER STATISTICS
## Description:
### Statistics issues can be one of the most difficult to troubleshoot. Often, DBAs and developers narrow down the expensive statement using DMVs. The DBA discovers that statistics are the root cause, but the effort to understand and correct the issue becomes difficult.     There are situations where recompilation will not help and recompiles have their own performance drawbacks.    This session is all about understanding and correcting statistics issues.    Statistics are an internal BLOB (statblob) representing data about data. This statistical data is maintained by SQL Server to help build query plans making decisions on accessing data based on the size and distribution of your actual data.    Most DBAs maintain these statistics by using the default auto update statistics and auto create statistics settings. This is a good start.    However, there are cases where the auto update of statistics is not enough and may not help address certain poorly performing queries and conditions. Additionally, the auto update statistics setting can cause performance issues on large tables forcing the DBA to turn this setting off.    In this session we will discuss several case scenarios where statistics are not being leveraged optimally.    Statistics can be out of date or have missing statistics, the optimizer might "guess" rather than leveraging statistics, the distribution of statistics may not be optimal, and other conditions can occur where the query plan is not constructed to best leverage statistics.    One of the first signs of statistics issues is slow and unpredictable query execution times. This can be due to statistical 'guessing', parameter sniffing, and other query plan conditions.    Statistics issues can occur after large insert operations on ascending or descending key columns and after certain maintenance operations.    We will discuss how to respond to these situations and how to designing queries that use statistics effectively.    To troubleshoot these situations it is often necessary to examine the query plans and to look at the SET STATISTICS PROFILE output. We will cover these troubleshooting efforts and others.    Finally we will cover new capabilities in SQL Server 2008, R2 / 2011 to address statistics issues by influencing plans and keeping plans when a good one is found. Using AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS_ASYNC, Filtered Statistics, plan freezing, and plan guides, and more will be covered to help get the upper hand on statistics issues.

## Speaker(s): 
## Title: SQL SERVER 2011 (Denali) - AVAILABILITY AND MANAGEABILITY ENHANCEMENTS
## Description:
### In this session we will cover the Availability and Manageability enhancements to  SQL Server 2011 "Denali"    For availability SQL Server "Denali" introduces the "HADR" solution for enhancing availability of user databases. "HADR" is a high-availability and disaster recovery solution to enable you to maximize availability for one or more of your user databases. "HADR" involves configuring one or more availability groups. Each availability group establishes the context within which a selected set of user databases can fail over as a single unit.     Similar to Database Mirroring, "HADR" involves a set of failover partners, known as availability replicas. Each availability replica possesses a local copy of each of the databases in the availability group. One of these replicas, known as primary replica, maintains the primary copy of each database. The primary replica makes these databases, known as primary databases, available to users for read-write access. For each primary database, another availability replica, known as a secondary replica, maintains a failover copy of the database known as a secondary database.     The SQL Server instances can be either failover cluster instances or stand-alone instances.     In this session we will discuss the "HADR" architecture and connectivity and discuss how it compares to other high availability options, we will discuss setting up and configuring "HADR", we will discuss role switching and failover methods.    We will also discuss allowing Read-Only Access to Secondary Replicas and monitoring "HADR" Availability Groups.    New Manageability features are:    The Query Editor introduces enhanced functionality for T-SQL debugging and IntelliSense.     The Watch window now supports watching Transact-SQL expressions.     T-SQL IntelliSense introduces the following:    * Breakpoint validation prevents setting a breakpoint in an invalid location.  * T-SQL code snippets are templates you can use as starting points when building statements.   * T-SQL Surround with snippets are templates you can use as starting points when enclosing sets of Transact-SQL statements in a BEGIN, IF, or WHILE block.    Other changes include:     Moving databases from one instance of the SQL Server Database Engine to another instance is simplified. Users in a contained database are no longer associated with logins on the instance of SQL Server.    Startup options are now configured by using a new Startup Parameters tab of Configuration Manager.

### For the past few years, XML has been making its way more and more into our SQL Server instances.  For a moment let’s forget that developers often find the need to store XML data in their databases.  Outside of those databases, XML has already invaded our SQL Servers.  It’s made its way into execution plans with the SHOWPLAN XML.  It’s telling us about deadlock through deadlock graphs.  It’s also presented to us through service broke, event notifications, and extended events.  XML is there and we need to learn how to query it.  In this session, we’ll explore some of the basic methods for querying XML through XQuery.  By the end of the session you’ll be equipped with the tools and understanding needed to ease yourself into XQuery.  Oh, and if you aren’t a DBA you can come too.

## Title: Developing an Information Governance Program using Master Data Services
## Description:
### In this session we will focus on developing an Information Governance Program and how this can be delivered with Microsoft Master Data Services. Listed below are some of the key factors to a successful Information Governance Program. This session will focus on how to deliver these concepts utilizing Microsoft Master Data Services and the Microsoft Office 2010 tools.   • Accountability. Because of the ways in which information is captured--and how it flows across the enterprise, everyone has a role to play in how it is governed. Many of the most important roles are played by individuals fairly junior in the organization. They typically play a key role data capture stage and often cause--or see-errors on a first-hand basis. Certain individuals need to be dedicated to Governance. These roles are filled by senior executives such as the CIO, Information Architects, and Data and Content Stewards.   • Efficient Operating Models. The Governance approach should define an organizational structure that most effectively handles the complexities of both integration and IM across the whole of the organization. Of course, there will typically be some degree of centralization as information flows across the business. However, this organizational model need not be a single, hierarchical team. The common standards, methods, architecture, and collaborative techniques so central to Governance allow this model to be implemented in a wide variety of models: physically central, virtual, or offshore..   • A Common Methodology. A Governance program should include a common set of activities, tasks, and deliverables. Doing so builds specific information management-based competencies. This enables greater reuse of artifacts and resources, not to mention increased productivity out of individuals. It also manifests the commonalities of different IM initiatives across the organization.   • Standard Models. A common definition of terms, domain values, and their relationships is one of the fundamental building blocks of Governance. This should go beyond a traditional data dictionary. It should include a lexicon of unstructured content. Defining common messaging interfaces allows for easy inclusion of “data in motion.” Business and technical definitions should be represented and, just as important, the lineage between them easy to navigate .   • Architecture. An IM architecture should be defined for the current-state, transition points, and target vision. The inherit complexity of this initiative will require the representation of this architecture through multiple views. Use of archite

## Description:
### Declarative database development has made great strides forward with the Visual Studio 2010 data tools allowing developers to focus on the model instead of the implementation.  But once you have the model, what are the options for deployment and what if your solution doesn’t match the Books Online example?  The session will demonstrate multiple ways to deploy database projects using TFS Build, MSBuild, VSDBCMD, Powershell and more.  For each deployment method, automation and customization techniques will be examined and demonstrated (including the common requirement of deploying one model to multiple targets.)  Attendees will leave with a better understanding of database deployment options when using Visual Studio 2010

## Speaker(s): Trevor Barkhouse
## Title: Quantitative Analysis of SQL Server Error Logs
## Description:
### The SQL Server error log is essential for administering SQL Server, especially when troubleshooting. Unfortunately the error log has existed in its current form, a flat text file, for at least seventeen years. Parameters are combined with message templates and the resulting strings are written to the log file. These entries are useful for review by administrators, but are not suitable for automatic processing (categorization, summarization, or trending). Regular expressions enable extraction of data from the logs; however most administrators do not think the benefit is worth the effort. A newly developed, open-source tool (a PowerShell module), lets you decompose error log contents into each entry's message ID and a delimited list of message parameters. In this atomic state, you can perform quantitative analysis of the error log data. I will demonstrate the PowerShell Cmdlets, analyze data in the new format, and then discuss the algorithm for decomposing error log entries.

## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: SQL Server Query Performance Tuning: Start to Finish
## Description:
### One of the most common problems encountered in SQL Server is the slow running query. Once a query is identified as running poorly, people frequently don’t understand how diagnose and fix the problem. This one day seminar focuses exclusively on these two topics, identifying the queries that are performing badly and figuring out how to fix them. We start by learning how to gather performance metrics including both server metrics and query metrics using tools available directly from Microsoft such as performance monitor, DMVs and Profiler. From there we’ll move into learning how the optimizer works and how it uses statistics to determine which indexes and other database objects can be used to assist the performance of a query. The session takes considerable time to show exactly how to generate and read execution plans, the one best mechanism for observing how the optimizer works. We’ll then look at other DMVs that can also assist you when performance tuning queries. With all this knowledge gathered, we’ll move into looking at common performance problems, how they evidence themselves in the metrics and execution plans, and how to address them. Finally, we’ll explore advanced methods for solving some of the more difficult query performance problems introducing such concepts as query hints, plan guides and plan forcing. Through all of this, best practices and common techniques will be reviewed. Attendees will go home with a working knowledge of query performance tuning, a set of methods for identifying poorly performing queries, scripts to assist in these processes and the knowledge of how fix performance problems in their own systems.

## Title: What To Do When It All Goes So Wrong
## Description:
### As IT Professionals we inevitably will see situations where everything goes wrong. At times we are somewhat lucky and this just means diminished functionality or a slow system. Other times our organization is temporarily out of business. Regardless of the scope of the issue, how we react can have a direct impact on how quickly things are returned to normal. This session will cover how to communicate issues, including what to say, who to say it to and when to say it. Part of managing communication is to get everyone into a room, forcing them to talk, so time will be spent on designing an effective war room. The session will also cover how by setting out to prove that an issue is ours we are able to more quickly get at a root cause and a solid solution to the problem at hand.

## Speaker(s): David Moutray
## Title: Sun Tzu and the Art of Software Development
## Description:
### Most software development projects fail.  They are either cancelled outright, vastly exceed their allotted budgets or are considered failures by the hapless end-users that are stuck with applications that have more bugs than a Roach Motel, run slowly and lock if more than two users try to use the same function at the same time.  Developing good software on budget and on time is a battle.    Sun Tzu on the Art of War, an ancient Chinese treatise on military strategy is required reading in the United States and around the world for military officers, business executives, attorneys and many others.  Readers from all walks of life have found key advice in its pages on leadership and overcoming life's challenges.    War may seem an odd metaphor for software development, but it is apt in at least two key respects:    The first is simply the difficulty of the basic problem.  Carl von Clausewitz famously said that "In war, everything is very simple, but even the simplest things are very hard, because the will is directed against an object which reacts."  Software development has its own version of this:  the Wicked Problem.    A Wicked Problem is a problem which cannot be solved until you have tried and failed at least once.  This is because you do not properly understand the problem when you first attack it.  Software development is filled with Wicked Problems.  Wicked Problems are the reason that estimating software development schedules is so difficult.    The second key similarity between war and software development is a four-letter word: T-E-A-M.  With all due respect to the US Army, there is no such thing as an "Army of One".  An army is a large team of people working to achieve a common goal under difficult, dangerous and arduous conditions.    Likewise, all but the most insignificant software is developed by teams.  Maintaining motivation, morale and focus during a long and difficult software development project is crucial to success.    During this session we will explore examples not only from the history of war, but also politics, business and even culture to illustrate the intimate connection between war and all human endeavor.    A great 19th century general said it best, "Strategy is more than a science: it is the application of knowledge to practical life, the development of thought capable of modifying the original guiding idea in the light of ever-changing situations; it is the art of acting under the pressure of the most difficult conditions."

## Speaker(s): David Moutray
## Title: Database "Insecurity"
## Description:
### Although we have had terrific tools for implementing fine-grained security since SQL 2005, database security remains one of the most neglected areas of database development.  Database security is left to the Network Administrator and System Administrator, yet over 500,000 personal records have been breeched in the United States alone just in the past few years.  Clearly, we as database professionals need to do our part, too.    It is also not enough to leave security to the Database Administrator.  Like Data Integrity, data security is difficult (if not impossible) to retrofit into an application after development.  (Question:  Why is the average database administrator paid 25% more than the average database developer?  I'll talk about that.)    Database security, like Data Integrity or Data Access Performance, must be a design goal if we are to achieve it.  This session is intended to get the participant to think about security from a design perspective and to illustrate some basic strategies for implementing security at the database level.

## Title: Back From the Dead: How to Restore a SQL Server in 60 Minutes or Less
## Description:
### While most DBAs know how to perform backups, restoring an entire SQL Server instance under the pressure of having to get the server up and running as soon as possible, is often another story. In this session, I will demonstrate, step-by-step, the entire process of restoring all of the system and user databases from a damaged instance to a new instance. By learning how to perform a quick server restore, not only will your manager and users be happier, you will feel a lot less stress when you are under the gun. This session is filled with demonstrations, and assumes attendees have a basic understanding of how to use the BACKUP and RESTORE commands. This session is most appropriate for DBAs who manage databases less than 100GB in size.

## Speaker(s): Ira Warren
## Title: (SSIS, TSQL and MDS) - Record Linkage(Fuzzy Matching) Advanced Implementations
## Description:
### We will implement several code samples based on a series of articles amd posts identifying similar records between two different sources or grouping of records from a single source, based on existing column string of values. We will define an approach, review actual implementations with various SQL tools(TSQL, VB,SSIS and MDS).    There are many facets to review. I would like to start by drawing concepts from several articles from experienced practitioners, either from academia or the commercial market. They will be footnoted at the end of the session.     Although we are discussing matching, we need to address several steps prior to getting to the actual use of matching algorithms. For this post, we will focus on the pragmatic steps required to accomplish identifying the relationships between records, and address how these steps fit into an overall data governance and data quality of MDM architecture.    We will review real world implementations of several hundred million records.    The steps required are shown here in a basic diagram:     The steps are as follows:   1. Cleansing and standardization   2. Group records   3. Split records   4. Compare records and determine scores   5. Split into separate match categories   6. Analyze results of matches   7. Evaluate using match tools to determine if best algorithms have been combined.    We will then implement this approach in TSQL and SSIS as well as explore the use of Fuzzy Matching in MDS.

## Speaker(s): Ira Warren
## Title: Creating a Metadata Mart with SSIS - Data Governance , Data Profiling & Code Generation
## Description:
### Recently I have had a client that required migrating and re hosting a data warehouse from the Oracle environment to the Netezza Appliance. The application had hundreds of tables and almost 2900 Source to Target Mappings. This would have taken 1000's of hours of manual coding. For this client we implemented a reusable data driven architecture, via SSIS, that rely on a metadata mart. The end result a greatly reduced TCO(development effort) for generating the code required vs manual coding. In addition the process leaves behind a metadata mart to report on for auditing and other Data Governance efforts. We generated over 100,000 lines of code and over 3000 load scripts. After implementation the application can be maintained via the tables and automatically regenerated, providing a pro active or self healing application architecture to respond to changes in incoming source files or target changes.

## Title: Dirty Data? Clean It Up!
## Description:
### Dirty data is everywhere, and it's headed for a database near you.  Extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) can be difficult, but often the most challenging component of that process is the validation and clean up of data.  Information must be cleansed in such a way that it retains its original message and business value, while conforming to the expectations of the destination system(s).  In this session, we will discuss some of the high-level challenges of dealing with dirty data, along with some infrastructure-agnostic recommended practices for doing so.  Further, we will dig in and get our fingernails dirty (pun intended) on some specific ways that SQL Server and SSIS can be used to cleanse incoming data.

## Speaker(s): Robert Davis
## Title: Developing a Multilevel Business Continuity Plan
## Description:
### High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) are often treated as distinct entities. These topics are closely related concepts that can fall under a single umbrella of Business Continuity (BC). Business Continuity is more than just being highly available or being able to recover from disaster. Business Continuity is all about keeping the business in business.    This should be the end goal of a good HA/DR plan. If you simply come up with an HA/DR plan without thinking about how it will affect the business, you may end up with a lot of unhappy people if disaster strikes or availability is affected in a way that had not been anticipated.    This session will guide you through the various high availability and disaster recovery options and will examine how the features compliment each other to form a comprehensive BC plan. This session is about more than just checking items on a checklist. Learn how you can set realistic business expectations for uptime and recoverability that set you up for success in the event of a disaster or unplanned downtime.

## Title: Growing Pains - A Cautionary Tale
## Description:
### It happens to everyone. One day your database is humming along quietly serving up choice nuggets of information quickly and efficiently while growing at a slow steady rate. The next day, your database has quadrupled in size and performance has ground to a halt as the system strains under the load.  Management is screaming for answers and you're coworkers are running in circles screaming for their lives.  In this session, we will examine how bad decisions and database design worst practices yielded an unwieldy monster that had the bravest of DBAs and database developers running for the hills.  As we travel through this tale we will see how, with a little cunning and trickery, a schema change or two, the beast was tamed and the database was brought back to life.  This session uses a real-world reporting system (names changed to protect the innocent) as the basis for its examples.  Your mileage may vary.

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Structures for Programmers
## Description:
### All too often a person will complain that SQL Server isn’t up to the task of enterprise databases, and usually there are two things wrong with this statement.  First, the person has a set of data that is hardly up to what SQL Server can deal with at “enterprise” level.  Second they have no knowledge of how data is stored or how to manipulate the physical structures to their benefit.  In this session, I will, at a reasonably high level cover most of the physical aspects of the SQL Server architecture page structures, table and index structures, files, and more, including some tips on how you can use these aspects to your advantage rather than struggling against the fundamentals of the SQL Server storage architecture.

## Title: Maximizing Parallelism Performance
## Description:
### Servers with multiple processors are now the de-facto standard. SQL Server 2008 R2 supports up to 256 processors. As a DBA you need to get a handle on how parallelism works in SQL Server so as to be able to troubleshoot any performance problems and maximize your parallelism performance. In this session Victor Isakov (MCT, MCM, MCA) will cover how parallelism works in SQL Server and how to best configure your SQL Server instance(s). He will then show how you can determine whether parallelism is "hurting" your query performance and what corrective action you can take. Finally Victor will go through a number of use cases of the different types of parallelism problems that you may see in the field.

### Users are mostly set in their ways when it comes to querying especially if they have been doing so for a very long time. The newer querying features of SQL Server are more powerful and suprisingly simpler to get the same results.  The performance of these new constructs are also superior.      Specifically, the analytical functions (CTE's) Row Number, Rank, Dense Rank, Cube, NTile, Compute, With Rollup & OVER clause will be discussed with examples. The windowing functions will demoed with practical usage scenarios. In addition, other "not commonly used" aspects like recursive querying, MERGE, "Grouping Sets" of GROUP BY and other SQL features will be covered.

## Title: Characteristics of a Great Relational Database 
## Description:
### When queried, most database professionals would mention normalized as one of the most important characteristics that tell the difference between a good and bad database design. I won't disagree in the least, but there is so much more to be considered.  Even if you did a great job of normalization, poor naming, poorly implemented keys, too many or too few indexes, and so on can derail your design.  In this session I will present seven primary characteristics of a design that differentiates between an ugly design that will have your colleagues nitpicking you to death and one that will have them singing your praises. Characteristics such as comprehendible, documented, secure, well performing, and more (including normalized, naturally) will be discussed.

## Speaker(s): Peter Trast
## Title: Policy Based Management
## Description:
### Maybe you were a system admin that got sucked into the exotic land of database administration because there was no one else to do it. Maybe you are a DBA on purpose. It might even be possible that one day you were writing web applications in your remote and intentionally isolated cube at the far end of the “trailer park” and faster than you can say DBCC CHECKDB REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS you found yourself in charge of an unwieldy, quickly expanding and barely governed SQL Server environment. In any case, you may have wondered, if there were some way to control the environment of SQL Server proactively and to have an automated way to enforce all of those naming convention standards and object settings that you TALKED about, documented and trained on. Have I got news for you!  In SQL Server 2008, a new feature called Policy Based Management (PBM) was introduced. The idea is that if you have a setting or convention that you wish to check for and/or ENFORCE (get your control freak on), you just create a policy that defines the object (maybe a database), a facet (the property that can be checked for or enforced, like the recovery model of a database), and a condition (the value of the property, like Full for the recovery model). Systems Administrators recognize this concept (Group Policy in Active Directory) but the application and verification of the policy is done quite differently. See what it is and how it’s done!

## Speaker(s): Kevin Boles
## Title: Death By UDF
## Description:
### User Defined Functions provide several benefits that developers strive for: code encapsulation and code reuse. But they come with the likelyhood of many huge downsides: severe performance impact, concurrency issues and even incorrect results. The "cursor-under-the-covers" that improperly coded scalar UDFs can cause also don't get represented in query plans and statistics IO output either, so even developers that might use those tools will be misled. We will review the various types of badness that can come from common UDF designs, including how to properly see what is going on. Then we will cover some refactors and a few tricks that can help mitigate the issues.

## Title: So You've Inherited the "DB From Heck"  (v2.0)
## Description:
### It's nice when, as database developers, we have a clean slate to work with. Most of the time, however, we inherit and must support existing designs and implementations. To add to the challenge, more often than not documentation of the database doesn't exist or is out-of-date with respect to the production system.    In this updated session, we'll start with a quick look at some tools, techniques, and scripts that will accelerate your understanding of that beast you're now in charge of supporting and extending.    After that, we'll explore some query-based methods for detecting design and implementation anomalies, and some things to consider when undertaking a project to correct such deficiencies.

## Speaker(s): Dmitri Korotkevitch
## Title: Baselining, trend analysis and system monitoring with Management Data Warehouse
## Description:
### Every year more and more businesses use Microsoft SQL Server as the backend database server in their mission-critical systems. High availability of these systems has become a standard requirement.  It is not uncommon to have a Service Level Agreement that does not allow more than a few minutes of downtime per calendar year. That forces DBAs to implement proactive monitoring solutions.    One of the key components of a proactive system monitoring strategy is baselining. Comparison of the current system state to a baseline helps understand changes in system load and behavior. Monitoring of these changes helps predict and avoid bottlenecks. Historically, system monitoring has been done based on system performance counters, DMO and SQL server traces. One of the challenges with this approach is the heterogeneous nature of the data collected. This requires additional processing and unification of the data before analysis can be performed. Another challenge is the correlation of different data streams. The standard SQL Server installation does not provide all the necessary tools to solve these problems out of the box.    Management Data Warehouse, introduced in SQL Server 2008, simplifies system troubleshooting tasks. The data provided by Data Collectors are unified and stored in a relational database. A set of standard reports allows drilling down to the various aspects of system load and behavior during performance troubleshooting. Unfortunately, the standard configuration for MDW is not optimal for the trend analysis aspects of system monitoring. The standard Data Collectors do not capture enough information to create a comprehensive baseline. As a result, there are no standard reports which can be used to analyze trends and predict possible bottlenecks.    This session will focus on customizations and enhancements to MDW and Data Collectors that will help with system baselining, monitoring and trend analysis. Specifically, it will demonstrate how to enhance existing and create new Data Collectors in order to obtain a comprehensive system baseline. It will give an overview of MDW database schema and object dependencies. And finally, it will show how to query the collected data for analysis, reporting and monitoring purposes.
