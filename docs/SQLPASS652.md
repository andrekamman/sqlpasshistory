## Speaker(s): David Klee
## Title: The Complete Primer to SQL Server Virtualization
## Description:
### Your SQL Servers are probably virtualized at this point, but do you feel you have lost that control over the infrastructure that you used to have when they were physical servers? Do the virtual SQL Servers “feel” slower after they were virtualized? When architected and managed with SQL Server in mind, this added layer will help improve the SQL Server’s availability and ability to change with the business, but only when executed properly.

Preview this all-day interactive and hypervisor-agnostic session that is designed to help data professionals learn more about virtualization and infrastructure, and discover how this new layer can be used to improve the management, availability, and performance of their databases. You will be exposed to all layers of virtualization underneath the SQL Server, from the storage to the hypervisor, and will discover many useful tips and tricks to tuning the database layer to boost performance and availability. The following topics will be addressed during the session:
• virtualization and infrastructure fundamentals
• the SQL Server Virtual Machine
• networking, support, and licensing
• High Availability and Disaster Recovery
• performance investigation and tuning of the entire stack.

# Dr. DMV: How to Use DMVs to Diagnose Performance Problems
#### [Back to calendar](#id-652)
Event Date: 07-09-2016 14:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Glenn Berry
## Title: Dr. DMV: How to Use DMVs to Diagnose Performance Problems
## Description:
### SQL Server 2005 introduced Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) that allow you to see exactly what is happening inside your SQL Server instances and databases with much more detail than ever before. SQL Server 2016 adds even more capability in this area. You can discover your top wait types, most CPU intensive stored procedures, find missing indexes, and identify unused indexes, to name just a few examples. This session preview (which is applicable to SQL 2005-2016), presents and explains over seventy DMV queries that you can quickly and easily use to detect and diagnose performance issues in your environment. 

If you have ever been responsible for a mission critical database, you have probably been faced with a high stress, emergency situation where a database issue is causing unacceptable application performance, resulting in angry users and hovering managers and executives. If this hasn't happened to you yet, thank your lucky stars, but start getting prepared for your time in the hot seat. This session will show you how to use DMV queries to quickly detect and diagnose the problem, starting at the server and instance level, and then progressing down to the database and object level. 

This session will show you how to properly analyze and interpret the results of every single query in the set, along with lots of information on how to properly configure your instance and databases.

# From XML to JSON
#### [Back to calendar](#id-652)
Event Date: 07-09-2016 16:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Guy Glantser
## Title: From XML to JSON
## Description:
### XML and JSON are two widely used markup languages, shared by many applications and data platforms. Since SQL Server 2005, there is native support for XML, which means we can extract relational data from XML documents as well as generate XML documents from relational data. We can also use namespaces, schemas, and indexes in order to apply constraints on the contents of XML documents, as well as to speed up query performance. SQL Server 2016 provides support for JSON, so that we can do more or less the same things with JSON.

In this preview session we will learn how to work efficiently with these two markup languages in SQL Server. We will discuss use cases for using either XML or JSON. We will compare a few methods and talk about the performance impact of each. If you’re a developer and you need to manipulate XML or JSON files in SQL Server, then this session is for you.

## Speaker(s): Patricio Cofre
## Title: Using Azure Machine Learning to Predict Consumer Price Index
## Description:
### Inflation is one of the economic phenomena that receive particular attention from public policy actors, because of its effects on the allocation of resources, the distribution of income, economic development, and on the wellbeing of societies. Therefore, having an early and reliable vision of inflation enables defining appropriate anti-inflationary policies to achieve stability in the purchasing power of currencies.

Through leveraging Azure+PowerBI resources for data scraping, analytics, and visualization, it is possible to obtain:
* access to continuously updated CPI forecasts
* various CPI breakdown (by segment, industry, etc.)
* costs reduction, compared to traditional processes for capturing and processing
* increased focus on internal analysts’ teams in analytical work itself
* increased quality and relevance of the information, which allows decision makers to have greater confidence in the indicators and predictions when making decisions.

#### [Back to calendar](#id-652)
Event Date: 08-09-2016 07:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: BI Information Delivery
## Speaker(s): Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: My Favorite Pie (Chart): Simple Rules for Clear Visualizations
## Description:
### Dataviz guru Stephen Few once stated that we should “save the pies for dessert”. What he meant is that pie charts are good in some specific-use cases, but they should not be used in others. The same is true for other chart types. Using the wrong type of chart will make it harder for report users to understand the story behind the data. To enable insights, information has to be presented in the most intuitive way possible. 

Join this session to preview five easy-to-implement rules, which will guide you through the process of creating clear and attractive visualizations. Every rule will be applied through live demos in Excel, Reporting Services, and Power BI Desktop, where you will learn how to avoid pitfalls from the defaults in those tools.
