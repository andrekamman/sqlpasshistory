### Migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project –a solid methodology is required for success. Microsoft provides you with all the tools you need to achieve a seamless, reliable upgrade experience.  In this session we will review some of the free tools that Microsoft provides in order to ensure your SQL Server upgrade is a success.

We will also discuss the merits and caveats of following a database compatibility-based upgrade along with the tools Microsoft is building to ensure customers have a smoother upgrade and migration experience.

After this session, you will be able to:
• Position Database Compatibility as a real alternative to support complex modernization projects as critical moments like 2008 End-of-Life.
• Leverage Microsoft SQL Server features and tools to support a DB Compat based upgrade or migration.

Event Date: 03-04-2019 20:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Taiob Ali
## Title: Performance Optimization with Azure SQL Database
## Description:
### The cloud is just using someone else's compute. You still need to care about and optimize for performance.  Just as a dropped call frustrates cellular customers, an app with data issues, high latency, connection timeouts will create the same frustration for users.  Do you want to catch the performance issues before your customers?  Do you want to automatically identify database issues and quickly drill down into details? Azure provides built in tools just to do that.

In this session I will show you 4 of those tools.  You will learn how these tools can provide Performance overview of a database and recommendations that can improve workload performance.  Find top resource consuming queries, deeper insight into your databases resource (DTU) consumption and learn when to let Azure  automatically optimize your database.
 
At the end of this session you will walk out knowing how to identify and tune Azure SQL database performance  issues with built in tools in Azure Portal.

#### [Back to calendar](#id-1012)
Event Date: 04-04-2019 08:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Markus Ehrenmueller-Jensen
## Title: From Power BI to Power AI – Enrich your Business Intelligence
## Description:
### AI is everywhere – and now even included in Power BI. Sometimes AI might be very apparent when you enrich your data with predictions by explicitly calling an Azure Machine Learning web service in Power Query. Sometimes it might by hidden in a nice little context menu when Power BI is auto-magically explaining the reason of a difference or a change over time in your data to you.

No matter if you are a business user, analyst or data scientist – Power BI has AI capabilities tailored to you. In this session we will cover how you can integrate and leverage the use of language R, how to integrate an Azure Machine Learning Service when loading data, what kind of insights Power BI is capable of delivering automatically, how you can create a complex new column without typing a single formula/function, how you can explore your data by asking questions in plain English, ... and more!

Sounds like a lot of content? I omitted most of the slides in favor to spend the time in live demos instead.

# Baselining and Alerting for Microsoft SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1012)
Event Date: 04-04-2019 15:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Lord Richard Douglas, Kevin Kline
## Title: Baselining and Alerting for Microsoft SQL Server
## Description:
### Ensuring peak performance on an instance of Microsoft SQL Server is not easy and requires a lot of work on the part of the DBA. Experienced DBAs know that to maintain the best possible performance, you need to make sure you are monitoring the right performance metrics on a regular basis. Using those metrics, you can determine what normal performance looks like under most workloads. After all, when troubleshooting, how can you tell what is abnormal performance if you don’t know what is normal? But how do you know what performance information to track and how to interpret it? Baseline comparisons can help.

This session describes techniques and procedures to monitor important performance metrics you can use to define as a baseline for “normal” performance. From there, we will show you how to use these baseline metrics to identify and alert on abnormal circumstances. In addition to the main objectives, this session will help you: 

•	Learn about the major metrics that quantitatively define the performance baseline for an instance of SQL Server
•	Learn how to collect baselines and, on a live SQL Server, compare and alert when performance metrics are outside of normal 
•	How to best utilize your newly freed time once you start to utilize baselines as a regular part of your workday

Baselining is a skill that separates junior DBAs from senior DBAs. Take the leap to learn this important skill today!

## Title: The Real Self-Tuning Database 
## Description:
### Back 20-odd years ago, Microsoft’s marketing team advertised SQL Server as a ‘self-tuning database’. It wasn’t. Fast forward a few years, and we now have database engines that are, in some circumstances, are self-tuning.

In this presentation, we’re going to look at the self-tuning aspects of SQL Server 2019, specifically the adaptive query processing features and Query Store’s automatic plan regression fixes.

### Lets take a close look at the world of Azure. 

You possibly know of the "Plane Effect". It means that your CIO or CTO possibly picked up the phrase "Cloud" in a tech magazine on one of his/her expensive trips to wherever. Now the whole company is running around it.
 
In this session we'll cover what points should you consider before going to Azure.
Here's a short list:

1.  Learn about your current footprint
2. Learn what to move
3. Learn how to move
4. Gather knowledge on Azure topics
5. Research a backup cloud provider!

Should you even really care or just look for another job?

We will learn how simple to use is the Azure portal. We will make a couple of VMs, Databases along the way.
