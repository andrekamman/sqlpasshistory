## Speaker(s): Andrew Brust
## Title: How to Tame Changes in the Big Data Market
## Description:
### Even as buyers continue to understand what it's all about, the Big Data market is changing. Hadoop's ecosystem is broadening, even to the point where Hadoop's own engine may cease to be required. Streaming data processing is rapidly increasing in importance, as is combining real-time and historical data in a single environment. Machine learning and predictive analytics are also gaining importance. 

Pick the wrong platform and you may be in for some turbulence. Pick the right strategy, though, and you'll be prepared for changes coming down the pipeline, including the ones we don't know about yet.
 
Andrew Brust, Senior Director at Big Data software company Datameer, and ZDNet's Big Data correspondent, will discuss trends and changes in the industry, as well as his predictions for what's next. He'll give you his take on how to navigate the uncertainty, get your Big Data projects moving, and blend Big Data technologies with the existing OLTP and Business Intelligence stacks that you're using right now.

## Description:
### Providing the tools to implement data analytics is only one part of a successful project. Collaboration policies, data management roles, security, and training are all necessary to ensure the wide adoption of data-based decision making throughout your organization. BA projects regularly require interaction with the technical teams who are responsible for ensuring the security, access, and storage of the data. 

During this deep-dive session, we will discuss practices and methods to foster and continue good collaborative relationships between technical and analytics teams. We will illustrate the methods needed to encourage users to adopt data-driven decision making using the Power BI toolset.  

Attendees will leave with a methodology they can implement in their environments to promote successful data-based decision making, with a foundation of proven methods provided to real clients across industries from a technical and management perspective.

## Speaker(s): Kevin Potcner
## Title: Accurately Measure Marketing Impacts by Controlling Geographic Differences
## Description:
### How can you control for differences in geographical regions in marketing studies so that those differences don’t adversely affect attempts at quantifying the impact of a particular marketing effort? This is a challenge frequently faced in large-scale marketing experiments where it’s often only possible to provide a marketing stimulus to an entire geographical area. In these experiments, marketers often employ the Test & Control Experimental framework (A/B Testing). 

In this framework, comparisons are made between different geographical regions where one region receives Marketing Stimulus A and another receives Marketing Stimulus B. Each geographical region, however, is unique. In order to isolate and accurately quantify the effect of each of those marketing stimuli under study, marketers need to somehow control for all the factors that could influence how each of those regions respond to marketing. In this session, you will learn a statistical technique known as Observation Clustering that can help marketers pair geographical regions that are most similar to each other across many different critical dimensions so that more accurate comparisons can be made.

## Speaker(s): Alex Hambelton, Paul Westerman
## Title: Taking the Analytics Reins: An Oregon Lottery Case Study
## Description:
### Many organizations can relate to being stuck trying to expand the use of analytics or feeling like the company can’t move past “the way it’s always been done.” There was a time when the Oregon Lottery (a billion-dollar business) was no different. Over the last year, we have moved from an organization that spent countless hours distributing hundreds of PDF reports to a place where stakeholders can now answer their own day-to-day questions with interactive dashboards. 

By using Microsoft’s Power BI tools, our users can access the company’s wealth of data while maintaining a familiar Excel look and feel. This session will show examples of the output, as well as our journey through limited stakeholder interest; challenges with finding the right tools and splicing data from various sources; and achieving high demands for expansion with stakeholders.

## Speaker(s): Michael Greene
## Title: Re-Tooling the Business of Government
## Description:
### A key tenet of any successful business is to focus service scope so that the organization is not overstretched. Few corporations would ever sign up for a business plan that included the provision of clinical services, restaurant inspections, curb-side garbage pickup, and the management of incarcerated populations. This is the precise challenge that local governments across the United States face daily. Further, many of these entities are faced with the challenge of ""doing more with less"" while facing tightening budgets, increased regulation, and the impending retirement of Baby Boomers. 

This session will focus on the actionable steps taken by one local government to enable its workforce, improve customer service, and re-tool its business through the use of BI. Real-life tools and dashboards will be demonstrated that are currently utilizing a diverse set of public and private sector data sources. Governance considerations made at each level of data consumption will be examined.

# Risk Analytics on the Microsoft Platform

## Speaker(s): Adam Worobec
## Title: Risk Analytics on the Microsoft Platform
## Description:
### It is important for every business to understand and respect risk. The risk analytics lifecycle requires multiple tools and techniques. It typically begins with risk analysts building models through which ideas are tested. The sound ideas are then incorporated into processes and used to guide decisions. Towards the end of the lifecycle, everyone is eager to see the actual performance of the business to make decisions on any necessary adjustments. If changes are needed, the cycle starts all over again. 

Historically, this process has been done with tools produced by a mix of vendors, resulting in a fragmented solution. Through Microsoft's embrace of open-source technologies and commitment to analytics, we now have a single platform on which we can complete every step of the risk analytics lifecycle. In this session, we'll walk through a real-world example and demonstrate how to do risk analytics on the Microsoft platform -- on-premises or in the cloud.

## Speaker(s): Bill Saltmarsh
## Title: Visually Exploring Data Sets to Find Meaning in the Data
## Description:
### This session is devoted to two of the most irreplaceable aspects of the analyst role, both of which allow us to uncover and communicate more truth to our users. First, you will see a roadmap for initially exploring a data set via a prescribed series of graphical analyses. These visualizations will allow you to uncover the most important aspects of a data set, eliminating the "noise". Then, you will learn how we can turn data into minimalist visualizations that make impacts. By focusing on the concept of less is more, you will learn best practices in creating views and dashboards that allow users to become truth seekers themselves.

## Speaker(s): Jen Underwood, Stephen Giles, Ted Way
## Title: You Just Pour Your Data in the Data Lake, Right?
## Description:
### Like all exciting new technologies, Big Data has generated its own hype. Concepts like Data Lakes, Real-time Streaming and Big Data’s ability to free us all from the shackles of the schema fill technical and business journals and blogs. There is huge benefit in expanding your data platform to include Big Data solutions. 

However, if you don’t take an holistic view of your entire data platform strategy, including governance and the needs of the business, you can end up creating another much larger, much more expensive data silo that is impenetrable to your users and your analytics systems. 

This session will help business users sift through the hype surrounding Big Data, and discuss some prevailing concepts and strategies in a vendor-agnostic way. It will highlight the pitfall and opportunities of incorporating Big Data into a larger data platform and help business leaders start with value and not technology.
