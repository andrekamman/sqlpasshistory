Event Date: 02-05-2016 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Analyze & Interpret
## Speaker(s): Daniel Fylstra
## Title: Advanced Analytics for Excel Users: Learn How to Do it Yourself
## Description:
### Data is the starting point, predictive analytics is the next step, but prescriptive analytics for decisions is the "top of the analytics food chain." This is where the biggest business payoffs, but also the biggest shortage of skilled analysts, are usually found. Attend this hands-on lab precon to get a thorough understanding of the advanced analytics and what-if modeling capabilities available in Excel.

We'll start the morning with the core ideas of data science, including an overview of statistics and machine learning, and focus on your key role in visualization and feature selection. By lunchtime, we'll move into a deeper understanding of data and predictions.

In the afternoon, we'll examine data-driven what-if models, and how to maximise decision trees, Monte Carlo simulations, and/or optimization to find the best choices, for business plans and processes with many future scenarios, and individual decisions.

## Title: Dueling Dashboards with Power BI and Power Pivot
## Description:
### Microsoft’s evolving strategy in BI and analytics has taken some very exciting turns over the past twelve months. What we used to call the Microsoft BI “platform” could now more appropriately be called an “ecosystem”: a suite of products that truly interoperate, are built upon the same core engines, and revolve around the same core languages.

In this full-day session, Matt Allington and Avi Singh of PowerPivotPro put that ecosystem through its paces for your benefit. Better yet, they have selected 10 real-world examples from their many years of experience, and will cover these patterns in their entirety so you can return to work and apply them immediately. All attendees will be provided with these examples in electronic format, complete with inline explanations and tips on adapting these patterns to your own needs, including:

•	variance from target/budget
•	outlier detection
•       performance against market
•	Opportunity Gap Analysis
•       Trending and Smoothing
•	geo targeting
•	customer retention
•	inventory burndown
•       Pattern based Reports
•	entity summaries.

Avi and Matt will treat this as a friendly competition as to who will provide you with the clearest real-world impact. Attendees will also receive a full-color copy of Rob Collie and Avi Singh’s new book, “Power Pivot and Power BI, 2nd Edn.”, as well as eight laminated reference cards.

# The Analyst’s Do’s and Don’ts of BI on Hadoop
#### [Back to calendar](#id-507)
Event Date: 03-05-2016 09:45 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Communicate & Lead
## Speaker(s): Dave Mariani
## Title: The Analyst’s Do’s and Don’ts of BI on Hadoop
## Description:
### If you think that Hadoop is not in your future, think again.  According to a recent survey, 97% of organizations dabbling with Hadoop anticipate they will be onboarding their workloads on Hadoop.  When this happens, the companies that have disregarded the Big Data opportunity, might be left behind.
 
The good news is that onboarding your Business Intelligence workloads on Hadoop is not as complicated as many vendors might have made it sound.  There are a few key concepts to understand but the transition doesn’t require you to rip and replace your technical stack, recycle your current skillset and replace every business analyst with a data scientist.  
 
In this interactive session, Bruno Aziza, Big Data author and business executive at AtScale, will take you through real-life examples of company successes.  He will dissects lessons and mistakes gathered along the Hadoop journey.  This will result in a best practice sharing session that will leave with a good set of rules he calls “the Do’s and Don’ts of BI on Hadoop”.

## Title: How to Tame Changes in the Big Data Market
## Description:
### Even as buyers continue to understand what it's all about, the Big Data market is changing. Hadoop's ecosystem is broadening, even to the point where Hadoop's own engine may cease to be required. Streaming data processing is rapidly increasing in importance, as is combining real-time and historical data in a single environment. Machine learning and predictive analytics are also gaining importance. 

Pick the wrong platform and you may be in for some turbulence. Pick the right strategy, though, and you'll be prepared for changes coming down the pipeline, including the ones we don't know about yet.
 
Andrew Brust, Senior Director at Big Data software company Datameer, and ZDNet's Big Data correspondent, will discuss trends and changes in the industry, as well as his predictions for what's next. He'll give you his take on how to navigate the uncertainty, get your Big Data projects moving, and blend Big Data technologies with the existing OLTP and Business Intelligence stacks that you're using right now.

## Speaker(s): Szilvia Juhasz
## Title: The Art-Science of Data Modeling in the Modern Age
## Description:
### As developers, solution providers, and early adopters of emerging technologies, it is easy to get excited by the all new possibilities the modern BI age offers. As we channel that enthusiasm into building the “best possible” data driven solutions for our customers, it remains important to stay grounded in core principles of systems development that have stood the test of time. These concepts are neither pure science nor art, but rather a bit of both.

In this session, we will dissect the “art-science” of model development using Microsoft Excel in a “9 step program” framework. We will explore how thoughtful requirements planning, design, and communication can make the difference between yet another “throw away” model and one that can drive business decisions, deliver real time insights, and even disrupt cultures to accelerate user adoption of modern BI tools.

Event Date: 03-05-2016 13:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Communicate & Lead
## Speaker(s): Dean Abbott
## Title: A Week in the Life of a Data Scientist
## Description:
### Predictive modeling contains six stages of analysis according to the Cross Industry Standard Process Model for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). I will break this down into three primary tasks for predictive modelers including preparing data, building models, and explaining results. 

Data preparation often requires skills in SQL, python, or other languages to be able to pull data out of data stores and convert the normalized data into flattened data that the algorithms can use to build models

Modeling requires a qualitative (if not quantitative) understanding of the algorithms, including mathematics or statistics, in order to bulid the effectively. 

Finally, modelers should know how to explain the results of their findings to other analysts and to decision-makers and stakeholders.

The session will walk through the building of a predictive model for a retail appliction: predicting the days to next purchase propensity model.

## Speaker(s): Ken Puls
## Title: From Input to Reporting: A Real Estate Forecasting Model
## Description:
### Creating models can be a complex science, particularly if the data is stored in a non-tabular form and needs to be updated by the users on a semi-regular basis.  Without discipline it is easy to see a model spiral into a dangerously fragile state, especially if the majority of the work is performed using complex formulas.
In this session Ken will share his tips for building complex models, illustrated through a case study of an economic forecasting model for a large real estate project comprising of over 2,500 units to be built over a 25 year span.
Techniques and discussion will focus around:
•	Model design considerations
•	Inviting and validating data inputs
•	Transforming data using modern tools
•	Creating maintainable reports
•	Adding model checks to immediately report model errors/issues
This is an expert level session that blends together several Excel techniques and technologies into one master solution.

## Speaker(s): Mark Tabladillo
## Title: Visualize Data Science with Sharable Jupyter for R and Python
## Description:
### This is a 2-hour lab session.

Jupyter is the new name for a proven open-source technology called  iPython.
Jupyter delivers analytics results in HTML and Javascript, allowing both formatted commentary and REPL windows (which will interpret and run code).  The Jupyter notebooks now work with several languages, but in this lab session we focus on two of the most popular data science languages: R and Python.
The  purpose of this lab is to provide mature code examples which allow you to evaluate how this open-source technology might fit in your organization or practice. With Jupyter you can share notebooks using multiple languages, interactive widgets (REPL) and big data tooling.
You do not need to know how to code either R or Python to come to this session. However, instead of trivial “hello world” level material, this lab includes several well-developed data science examples in Jupyter.  You can run these on your own lab machine within the time frame.  Also included will be some code variants which you can apply and run.
While Jupyter is targeted at the desktop, the code in these notebooks can be scaled into a production environment.  You will see how this might be done (for example) in the Microsoft ecosystem.

# Accurately Measure Marketing Impacts by Controlling Geographic Differences
#### [Back to calendar](#id-507)
Event Date: 03-05-2016 17:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Analyze & Interpret
## Speaker(s): Kevin Potcner
## Title: Accurately Measure Marketing Impacts by Controlling Geographic Differences
## Description:
### How can you control for differences in geographical regions in marketing studies so that those differences don’t adversely affect attempts at quantifying the impact of a particular marketing effort? This is a challenge frequently faced in large-scale marketing experiments where it’s often only possible to provide a marketing stimulus to an entire geographical area. In these experiments, marketers often employ the Test & Control Experimental framework (A/B Testing). 

In this framework, comparisons are made between different geographical regions where one region receives Marketing Stimulus A and another receives Marketing Stimulus B. Each geographical region, however, is unique. In order to isolate and accurately quantify the effect of each of those marketing stimuli under study, marketers need to somehow control for all the factors that could influence how each of those regions respond to marketing. In this session, you will learn a statistical technique known as Observation Clustering that can help marketers pair geographical regions that are most similar to each other across many different critical dimensions so that more accurate comparisons can be made.

Event Date: 03-05-2016 17:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Discover & Integrate
## Speaker(s): Avi Singh
## Title: Power Pivot versus Power Query
## Description:
### If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. To build a successful Power BI solution, you need to know when to wield  Power Pivot vs Power Query. Power Pivot is a powerful data modeling tool with a rich formula language (DAX). Power Query lets you clean, shape and transform your data and whip it into shape.
 
If you do not use Power Query to shape your data model correctly, you end up writing overly complex DAX measures in Power Pivot. If you are using Power Query to do Power Pivot's job, you end up with a highly inefficient data model.
 
Avi Singh, has worked with numerous Fortune 500 clients, where he has seen Power BI solutions of all shapes and sizes. Avi, would present real life examples of "bad" Power BI behavior and show you how to remedy that with the right dosage of Power Pivot and Power Query. If your goal is to build a healthy - agile and scalable - Power BI solution, this session is just what the doctor ordered.

## Speaker(s): Adam Worobec
## Title: Risk Analytics on the Microsoft Platform
## Description:
### It is important for every business to understand and respect risk. The risk analytics lifecycle requires multiple tools and techniques. It typically begins with risk analysts building models through which ideas are tested. The sound ideas are then incorporated into processes and used to guide decisions. Towards the end of the lifecycle, everyone is eager to see the actual performance of the business to make decisions on any necessary adjustments. If changes are needed, the cycle starts all over again. 

Historically, this process has been done with tools produced by a mix of vendors, resulting in a fragmented solution. Through Microsoft's embrace of open-source technologies and commitment to analytics, we now have a single platform on which we can complete every step of the risk analytics lifecycle. In this session, we'll walk through a real-world example and demonstrate how to do risk analytics on the Microsoft platform -- on-premises or in the cloud.

Event Date: 04-05-2016 13:00 - Category: Lab (120 minutes) - Track: Analyze & Interpret
## Speaker(s): Dean Abbott
## Title: Predictive Analytics for Business
## Description:
### This is a 2-hour lab session.

This session describes the six stages of predictive analytics projects according to the CRISP-DM predictive modeling framework: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. Each stage is described from the analyst’s perspective, providing insights into what the science tells us about each stage, and where theory falls short to help us make about how to proceed in building models.
 
After completion of the lab, participants should be able to load data, perform simple data preparation, and create predictive models from modeling data sets. The data preparation steps will include filling missing values and creating dummy variables. Predictive modeling steps will include sampling, building models with decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks. Even though we are using only the KNIME software, the principles will apply to any workflow-style predictive analytics software package.

## Title: Build an Activity-Based Costing System for Analysis
## Description:
### In this session we look at how you can create an Activity-Based Costing System using Power BI for the allocation model and end-user reporting. Having the final report model in Power BI gives you the ultimate control over reporting, including adding other information possibly not even held with Information Technology.

We will use a real-world health care model to show how we replaced an expensive, difficult to understand and maintain SAS system, with a simple, elegant, and auditable solution based on the Microsoft stack. The rules are table-driven with allocated costs handling built in.

Event Date: 04-05-2016 14:30 - Category: Breakout Session (120 minutes) - Track: Visualize & Inform
## Speaker(s): Bill Saltmarsh
## Title: Visually Exploring Data Sets to Find Meaning in the Data
## Description:
### This session is devoted to two of the most irreplaceable aspects of the analyst role, both of which allow us to uncover and communicate more truth to our users. First, you will see a roadmap for initially exploring a data set via a prescribed series of graphical analyses. These visualizations will allow you to uncover the most important aspects of a data set, eliminating the "noise". Then, you will learn how we can turn data into minimalist visualizations that make impacts. By focusing on the concept of less is more, you will learn best practices in creating views and dashboards that allow users to become truth seekers themselves.

Event Date: 04-05-2016 14:30 - Category: Breakout Session (120 minutes) - Track: Analyze & Interpret
## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: DAX 2015 News and Patterns
## Description:
### In this 2-hour session, Marco Russo will showcase the new features of DAX 2015 - the latest version of the DAX language available in Excel 2016, Power BI Desktop and Analysis Services 2016.

The latest version of DAX has many new functions to make writing complex calculations easier than before. The simpler ones are in statistical and financial area, but you will discover many new table functions that are useful to both report developers who write or generate DAX queries, and business analysts creating calculations that require temporary, intermediate tables for different calculation steps.

One of the most important new features is the introduction of variables. You can store values and tables in variables that can be used in more complex expressions. This powerful feature also eliminates the need for EARLIER and EARLIEST in all expressions, as you will see comparing the same code written with and without the variables.

During the session, you learn new functions and features of DAX through many practical examples and patterns and learn about common pitfalls to avoid, regardless of which DAX version you use. 

A basic knowledge of DAX syntax and some experience in its use is required to attend the session.

“Disrupt the static nature of BI with Predictive Anomaly Detection” – Uri Maoz
The static nature of BI today result business insight latency, which cost companies millions of dollars. Data-centric companies like web-based businesses, digital advertising and IoT need to gain crucial real time business insights in order to optimize their business performance. Join Uri to learn how this can be achieved using Predictive Anomaly Detection approach. Uri will share advantages and challenges in implementing Anomaly Detection approach, Industry benchmark and Customers case studies.  

“Learn Predictive Analytics Using XLMiner in Excel or Your Web Browser” – Dr. Sima Maleki
The best way to learn predictive analytics is to “do it yourself,” which can be easier than you think with the right tools. R or Python programming expertise isn’t required – you just need “analytic common sense,” and either Microsoft Excel, or a web browser. In this lightning session, you’ll get a quick look at how you can sample data from sources like Azure SQL databases and Apache Spark Big Data clusters; explore and visualize your data; transform free-form text into structured data with text mining methods; identify key variables using feature selection; easily apply forecasting and machine learning methods to build your own predictive models; evaluate and compare model performance, from linear and logistic regression to decision trees and neural networks; and “score” new data. 20 minutes won’t make you an expert, but you’ll get pointers to textbooks and online courses where you can learn more.

“Use Automation to Deliver Agile Data Projects” – Douglas Barrett
Agile development is the holy grail of data projects.  Business users want agility – they want speed, they want access to data and they want to be able to figure out deliverables once they see the data.  Traditional IT data projects, tools and data warehouses can't keep up.  The desktop tools that the business can use are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but cut IT out of the picture.  These solutions are unregulated, unmonitored, localized, don’t keep history, and depart from one version of the truth.  Data Warehouse Automation makes IT agile.  It solves the primary issue that IT is too slow, they need to know what you want before you start and making changes is painful.  
Come and see what Data Warehouse Automation is all about and how it keeps the business happy at hundreds of companies like Costco, Union Bank, VW, Nordstrom with IT led Projects.

# You Just Pour Your Data in the Data Lake, Right?
#### [Back to calendar](#id-507)
Event Date: 04-05-2016 15:45 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Communicate & Lead
## Speaker(s): Jen Underwood, Stephen Giles, Ted Way
## Title: You Just Pour Your Data in the Data Lake, Right?
## Description:
### Like all exciting new technologies, Big Data has generated its own hype. Concepts like Data Lakes, Real-time Streaming and Big Data’s ability to free us all from the shackles of the schema fill technical and business journals and blogs. There is huge benefit in expanding your data platform to include Big Data solutions. 

However, if you don’t take an holistic view of your entire data platform strategy, including governance and the needs of the business, you can end up creating another much larger, much more expensive data silo that is impenetrable to your users and your analytics systems. 

This session will help business users sift through the hype surrounding Big Data, and discuss some prevailing concepts and strategies in a vendor-agnostic way. It will highlight the pitfall and opportunities of incorporating Big Data into a larger data platform and help business leaders start with value and not technology.
