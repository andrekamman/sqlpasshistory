## Speaker(s): Hamish Watson
## Title: DevOps and the DBA
## Description:
### You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.

In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at two aspects of DevOps - Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team. It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

?Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Database migrations/changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise Continuous Delivery.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to a running database hosted in Azure the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement Continuous Delivery in their database systems deployment pipeline.

## Speaker(s): Anthony Nocentino
## Title: I Needed to Install 80 SQL Servers…Fast. Here’s How I Did It!
## Description:
### Challenged with this problem, let me show you how I used PowerShell Desired State Configuration to deploy and configure 80 SQL Servers for a client, fast! For this task, I needed to go from DSC Zero to DSC Hero. In this “notes from the field” session, I’ll share with you how I was able to achieve my client’s goals.

## Speaker(s): Alex Yates
## Title: DevOps, Dev Data and Data Breaches: 5 Solutions
## Description:
### Developers want prod data for dev and test purposes. It helps them to write better code and to test it effectively. Self-service access to usable test-data aligns well with DevOps principles that encourage teams to adopt a shift-left mentality to testing.

Unfortunately, in the age of data breaches and tighter regulation it's unwise to give developers access to some types of sensitive production data.

So what do you do?

In this session I’ll talk about the GDPR, anonymisation, pseudonymisation and 5 techniques you can use to provide appropriate data that is as “production-like” as possible (within the legal and technical constraints). I’ll demo these techniques both in raw T-SQL and using some of the Microsoft and third party tools that are available to make the task easier.

After this session you’ll be equipped to discuss the problem with your colleagues in an informed manner and you’ll be able to suggest several several solutions and their relative pros and cons.
