## Speaker(s): Michael Otey
## Title: The Windows DBA’s Jump Start for SQL Server on Linux
## Description:
### This session is intended for Windows DBAs who want to get a jump start with SQL Server on Linux. First, you’ll learn about the feature set supported by SQL Server on Linux and how it’s different from Windows. Then you’ll get a quick cheat sheet and see examples of running the essential Linux management commands like finding your IP address and host name, navigating directories and using Bash. Next, I’ll walk through the SQL Server on Linux installation and connection process and then jump into showing how you can migrate databases and manage SQL Server on Linux using both SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) as well as SQL Operations Studio. You’ll see how to use the SSMS Dashboard and Query Store to get performance data. Finally, you’ll learn how to install and use SQL Agent and SQL Server Integration Services as well as the new cross platform tools like mssql-cli and mssql-scripter.

## Speaker(s): Phil Ekins
## Title: SQL Sprawl - Get a Handle on Your Infrastructure
## Description:
### This session will provide you with tools to assess your existing SQL deployments, both physical and virtual. We will share methods to help you determine what’s being installed (with or without your knowledge) in your environment. Discover how resources are being utilized and how your instances are licensed. Determine what can be combined, right-sized, or retired and if your existing licenses make sense in your environment, or if your licensing plan needs adjustment. Leave this session with a road map to help you make a case for virtualization (if you’re not there yet) and the tools you need to get a handle on your SQL sprawl.

## Title: Monitoring and Tuning Azure SQL Database
## Description:
### Being able to monitor and tune the performance of your database is an important part of any database professional's job. Azure introduces a host of new tools and capabilities designed to make optimizing your managed databases easier than ever. In this session, attendees will be introduced to using tools such as Query Performance Insights, Intelligent Insights, and Automatic Tuning to monitor and tune the performance of their Azure SQL Databases.

# SQL Server Containers for Developers

Event Date: 25-04-2018 17:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Julie Lerman
## Title: SQL Server Containers for Developers
## Description:
### Thanks to Docker and Windows Containers, it's now possible to have a no-fuss, full SQL Server instance on your development, test or QA machine. You can use SQL Server for Linux in a Docker container on any platform that supports a Docker engine or SQL Server in Windows Containers. The containers allow you to instantly spin up one or more SQL Servers as needed and wipe them out then restart a clean instance when the time is right. This makes for a killer developer environment to have the full power of SQL Server on-the-fly. It also is a boon for automated test environments where you need to run integration tests against SQL Server. This session, which will provide a step-up for Docker newbies, focuses on using Docker to get, run and manage SQL Server for Linux instances. You'll also learn about persisting data and how to create and share an image with your own database already on it. We'll use the awesome new cross-platform SQL Operations Studio to check out the databases served up from the containers.

## Speaker(s): Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Pods, Containers, and SQL Server--What You Need to Know
## Description:
### In the last decade there have been massive evolutions in infrastructure. Servers got virtual, then those VMs went to the cloud. Containers, and container orchestration using Kubernetes take those abstractions several steps further. In this session you will learn about:

--The benefits of flexibility of containers
--How containers work, and how they are different from virtual machines
--How SQL Server works with containers
--How to get started with containers in your test environment

Join us for a demo filled session to learn about the future of infrastructure.

## Title: Microsoft Business Intelligence on Linux
## Description:
### The big announcement in SQL Server 2017 was support for running it on a Linux platform.  However, not everything runs on this platform.   We will talk about the Microsoft BI stack (SSAS, SSIS, SSRS) and the limitations installing on Linux.   The presentation will primarily talk about SSIS as the other services are not available on the Linux platform.  We will cover things like installation, limitations and connections.   You will get a good overview of what you need to know before starting to bring up BI systems on SQL Server on Linux.

## Title: Nine Realms of Power BI
## Description:
### Planning a Power BI solution & need to understand options & choices?  There is much to consider as you discover your inner Data Avenger.  Power BI solutions have 9 Realms - or possible solution architectures.  It's easy to get started but things can get complicated quickly...  Should you import your data & use the cloud service? or keep your data on-premises using the gateway?  Should you use DirectQuery or direct access to Analysis Services, multidimensional or tabular, in Azure or on-prem?  What's the best method to secure data & control user access?  What to license?  How will users access dashboards & reports?  Can it be embedded?  A hammer or other tools?
From simple desktop & published reports, to enterprise-scale and highly-secured solutions; we will demystify all these options & provide a roadmap to conquer the Nine Realms; from Midgard to Asgard, and from Desktop to Power BI Avenger.

## Title: SQL Server & Containers
## Description:
### SQL Server 2017 introduced the first version of SQL Server to run on Containers.  That’s amazing!!  What’s a Container?  You may be asking that very question along with why do I care and what does this do for me?  Containers offer the flexibility to run SQL Server on Linux and on Windows, to spin up SQL Server instances quickly, and enable Dev Ops Teams.  You may be asking, ‘I can do that in a VM, is a container a VM?’.  No, it is different and it presents us with a whole new set of options.  Together let’s dive into the topic of containers and how we can leverage SQL Server to meet your needs.

## Title: What you Need to Know about SQL Server and Docker Containers
## Description:
### Containers can change the way you develop and deploy your applications. In this presentation you’ll get an end-to-end understanding of how to use containers with SQL Server. First, you’ll see a demo of deploying a new SQL Server container in a meter of minutes. Then you’ll get a walkthrough of building your first SQL Server container where you’ll setup the container host then pull the SQL Server image from a public repository and use it to create SQL Server containers. Then you’ll see how you can connect to and manage containerized SQL Server instances. Then you’ll dive into the details of container architecture and networking. Next, you’ll get a step-by-step guide to build your own custom SQL Server container images. Here you’ll see how you can control container resource usage as well as how you take control of the container startup process to attach databases.

Event Date: 26-04-2018 04:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Guy Glantser
## Title: Monitoring Page Splits in SQL Server
## Description:
### Monitoring page splits in SQL Server is useful. It can be very useful, for example, in order to choose the appropriate fill factor for an index. By monitoring the number of page splits for a particular index over a period of time, we can determine whether the fill factor for that index should be adjusted in order to reduce the number of page splits and improve the overall performance.
In this session we are going to demonstrate all the possible options to monitor page splits in SQL Server, and we are going to show that all of these options are wrong. SQL Server is lying, and we're going to prove it. We will then demonstrate the only (documented) method to correctly monitor page splits in SQL Server as of today.
