## Title: SQL Server Containers for Developers
## Description:
### Thanks to Docker and Windows Containers, it's now possible to have a no-fuss, full SQL Server instance on your development, test or QA machine. You can use SQL Server for Linux in a Docker container on any platform that supports a Docker engine or SQL Server in Windows Containers. The containers allow you to instantly spin up one or more SQL Servers as needed and wipe them out then restart a clean instance when the time is right. This makes for a killer developer environment to have the full power of SQL Server on-the-fly. It also is a boon for automated test environments where you need to run integration tests against SQL Server. This session, which will provide a step-up for Docker newbies, focuses on using Docker to get, run and manage SQL Server for Linux instances. You'll also learn about persisting data and how to create and share an image with your own database already on it. We'll use the awesome new cross-platform SQL Operations Studio to check out the databases served up from the containers.

## Title: Power BI for Master Data Management
## Description:
### Have you ever come across such business scenarios when you feel you have challenged your Reticular Activating System to find an “out-of-the-box solution for Master Data Management in your Reporting System”? Have you ever thought about a self-service BI system, designed and customized, only for your Master Data? Often times, in IT industry executives neglect the fact that 30% of their data visualization contains Master Data. 

Integrating Master Data Services with Power BI, and presenting analytics on top only Master Data, can provide a high-end leverage to your organization. Whether it is a location model, a product model, a customer model etc., executives can highly be insightful from a report that contains all master data domains consolidated with a better visualization. Using individual subscription views from Master Data Services(SQL Server 2017) in Power Query, and utilizing all the cross referenced entities across models in MDS – can lead to a great one page report via Power BI.

## Title: Nine Realms of Power BI
## Description:
### Planning a Power BI solution & need to understand options & choices?  There is much to consider as you discover your inner Data Avenger.  Power BI solutions have 9 Realms - or possible solution architectures.  It's easy to get started but things can get complicated quickly...  Should you import your data & use the cloud service? or keep your data on-premises using the gateway?  Should you use DirectQuery or direct access to Analysis Services, multidimensional or tabular, in Azure or on-prem?  What's the best method to secure data & control user access?  What to license?  How will users access dashboards & reports?  Can it be embedded?  A hammer or other tools?
From simple desktop & published reports, to enterprise-scale and highly-secured solutions; we will demystify all these options & provide a roadmap to conquer the Nine Realms; from Midgard to Asgard, and from Desktop to Power BI Avenger.

## Title: Goldilocks and The Three Linux Bears
## Description:
### Bears don't hibernate and neither should your skills! Just like Goldilocks, we wandered into a strange 
and fascinating place. Learning something new can be just like her experience. 
Sometimes it's too hard with too many commands to memorize at the command prompt. 
Other times, too easy, wasting our precious brain cells on topics we already have mastered. 
Then we stumble on a rare moment when things are just right. Have you ever had that golden moment? 

In this session, we will focus on creating a VM Linux server to install SQL 2017 and connect to it using SQL Operations Manager and Visual Studio Code.  We'll briefly meet Papa bear and talk about pre-installation steps in Hyper-V before installing a Linux server.  We'll see by Mama bear by going over topics like repositories and package management.  Then we will get it just right by installing SQL Server, SQL Operations Manager and Visual Studio Code on a Linux desktop taking those baby steps learning something new.

Attend this session to get the bear facts with starting your Goldilocks journey with SQL on Linux.

## Title: SQL Server & Containers
## Description:
### SQL Server 2017 introduced the first version of SQL Server to run on Containers.  That’s amazing!!  What’s a Container?  You may be asking that very question along with why do I care and what does this do for me?  Containers offer the flexibility to run SQL Server on Linux and on Windows, to spin up SQL Server instances quickly, and enable Dev Ops Teams.  You may be asking, ‘I can do that in a VM, is a container a VM?’.  No, it is different and it presents us with a whole new set of options.  Together let’s dive into the topic of containers and how we can leverage SQL Server to meet your needs.

Event Date: 26-04-2018 04:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Guy Glantser
## Title: Monitoring Page Splits in SQL Server
## Description:
### Monitoring page splits in SQL Server is useful. It can be very useful, for example, in order to choose the appropriate fill factor for an index. By monitoring the number of page splits for a particular index over a period of time, we can determine whether the fill factor for that index should be adjusted in order to reduce the number of page splits and improve the overall performance.
In this session we are going to demonstrate all the possible options to monitor page splits in SQL Server, and we are going to show that all of these options are wrong. SQL Server is lying, and we're going to prove it. We will then demonstrate the only (documented) method to correctly monitor page splits in SQL Server as of today.
