## Speaker(s): Bob Ward
## Title: Inside SQL Server Wait Types (90 Mins)
## Description:
### Have you ever encountered a wait type with SQL Server but can't find any information on what it means? Perhaps you have thought the meaning of these is hidden away somewhere in a dark closet? In this talk, we will explore the internals of wait types within the SQL Server Engine. Rather than cover some of the more common wait types such as lock and latches, we will explore the more advanced and obscure wait types that may be surfaced by the engine. The ones you can't find much information about.

In this talk, we will cover (but not limited to) the following topics:
-Internal algorithms of wait types in the engine
-Exploring some of the more advanced wait types in the engine
-PREEMPTIVE wait types in SQL Server 2008
-What are some of the wait types that you can safely ignore and why?
-Learning to use Extended Events to debug wait types
-How to interpret information about wait types in SQL Server DMVs and metadata

This talk is a very advanced 500 level session that may include the use of advanced diagnostics such the Windows debugger and discussion of Windows APIs. I will assume the audience has a basic working knowledge of the SQL Server engine including an understanding of some of the more common SQL Server Engine DMVs such as sys.dm_exec_sessions, sys.dm_exec_requests and sys.dm_os_wait_stats.

## Speaker(s): Steve Simon
## Title: Data Access Layers.. A road map to smarter, efficient, and effective queries
## Description:
### How often have our SQL Servers been bogged down with a myriad of users issuing lengthy and poorly constructed or poorly performing queries against our tables and views. More often than not, nearly bringing our systems to their knees. Nowhere is this truer than within the financial world where heavy number crunching is par for the course. This beginners to intermediate level hands-on presentation is aimed at the SQL Server developer and business analyst alike and will show the attendee how we have managed to eliminate 90 % of our poorly performing queries by creating a data access layer which provides our end users with a suite of well developed and tuned SQL Server FUNCTIONS and UDT's with which to render their data. The presentation will discuss the high level principles and concepts behind our data access layer, the scenarios under which we have benefited from its usage and then compare and contrast some of the poorly performing queries that we once had..with some more efficient and effective queries that we have now provided to our end users.

## Speaker(s): 
## Title: SQL Server Data-tier Application Lifecycle Management: Why and How
## Description:
### DBAs and developers alike find it hard to effectively develop, deploy and manage a database application throughout its lifecycle. The absence of a single unit of reasoning aggravates the problem. SQL Server developers today want to create a data-tier application they can test and deploy it across multiple instances while SQL Server DBAs find the need to manage data-tier applications more than just a bunch of scripts. Microsoft's investment in the SQL Server data-tier application space brings in concepts and tools to simplify development and deployment of data-tier applications. Application and multi-server management was announced at SQL PASS 2008. In this session we dive into the scenarios for developing a data-tier application and deploying it on SQL Server using features in SSMS and in Visual Studio.

## Title: Disk Partition Alignment: Increase Disk I/O Throughput By 10%, 30%, or More - The Best Kept Secret in SQL Server Disk I/O Performance
## Description:
### Now that SQL Server wait stats are formally documented & DMVs are available, disk partition alignment may be the best kept secret related to database performance optimization. In combination with stripe unit size & file allocation unit size, learn how you can increase I/O throughput by 10%, 30%, & under some circumstances even more. Many customers are unaware of partition alignment. Even experienced disk administrators may be unfamiliar with it. Explanations are often initially met with disbelief. Engineers familiar with the topic may underestimate its importance. For example, some customers think it is useful only for Microsoft Exchange Server. In fact, partition alignment is important for all servers from which high performance is expected, especially SQL Server. Each month I encounter customers with unaligned storage. Until existing misaligned partitions created using Windows Server 2003 or Windows 2000 Server are rebuilt properly, disk partition alignment will remain a relevant technology.

## Speaker(s): Brad McGehee
## Title: Manage Your DBA Career, Dont Let it Manage You
## Description:
### It has been my experience that many people tend to "fall into" their career instead of them making a conscious decision as to what their career should be. Because of this, many people wander about in their career, not particular satisfied with how their career (or their life) is going. Instead of letting your career manage you, I strongly urge all DBAs to manage their own career by consciously taking control of it. By doing so, not only will you have a financially rewarding career, but a career that gets you excited about life and your contribution to it. In this session, I will outline specific steps you can follow so that you take control of your career. These steps include: defining your career path, deciding if you want to be an average or exceptional DBA, selecting a career specialty, determining how to match your career with your personal life, developing the appropriate skill sets, and managing your brand. If you want to be successful in your career, it all boils down to the following: 1) deciding what you want out of your career; 2) developing specific goals; and 3) taking action. If you don't take charge of your career, no one else will.

## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: SQLBI Methodology
## Description:
### Data Warehouses have a solid foundation, with different modeling options formalized in several books and whitepapers. Nevertheless, when it comes to implement a Data Warehouse using the SQL Server suite, you have to make several decisions about technology and implementation, which are very specific to SQL Server. These decisions might cause the success or the failure of your Data Warehouse project. This session will introduce you to the SQLBI Methodology. This approach has been developed over the years focusing all the architectural and technological decisions that you have to make when implementing a complete Business Intelligence solution using SQL Server, Integration Services and Analysis Services. This methodology is thought for Data Warehouse of medium-large complexity but, having a reduced overhead compared to the classical Kimball methodology, it is usable on small Data Warehouses too. The great advantages of the SQLBI Methodology are the flexibility in terms of design and maintenance. The draft papers about SQLBI Methodology are downloadable from http://www.sqlbi.com/sqlbimethodology.aspx

## Speaker(s): John Cook
## Title: Solving the Bill of Materials Problem
## Description:
### There has never been a standard for storing and processing hierarchical data. Over the years, multiple approaches have emerged. Oracle provides the START WITH...CONNECT BY PRIOR syntax. Joe Celko even wrote an entire book on the subject. With SQL Server 2008, the new hierarchyid data type offers an easily understand and implemented approach to storing hierarchical data. It can be implemented with either breadth-first or depth-first indexing for navigating the hierarchy, which makes it a flexible and viable solution for handling hierarchical data while delivering good performance. To illustrate the usefulness of the hierarchyid data type, this session will tackle a problem of great financial and business significance to the manufacturing industry: Bill Of Materials (BOM). All of the various forms of the Bill of Materials (engineering, manufacturing, sales, service) are comprised of hierarchical data. Individual parts are assembled into units called subassemblies. Subassemblies and individual parts are assembled into finished goods. The BOM problem is explained in detail so that the application developer thoroughly understands the requirements. Next, the audience is shown how to take the requirements and transform them into a logical hierarchical model. Finally, the audience is shown how to take the logical design and use SQL Server's hierarchyid to implement the physical design. Implementing a BOM solution with SQL Server 2008 provides the developer with the skills to solve similar problems such as modeling an organizational structure, a set of tasks in a project, or web site navigation graphs.

Event Date: 03-11-2009 15:00 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application Development
## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: DMV's as a Shortcut to Procedure Tuning
## Description:
### Dynamic Management Views and Functions (DMV/F) expose a wealth of information to the database administrator. However, they also expose information that is vital to the database developer. Most of the time you gather query performance data through server-side traces. This session will show how to gather information from the DMV/Fs for currently executing, and recently executed queries. It will demonstrate combining this information with other DMV/Fs to get the query text. I'll show how to also retrieve execution plans. With the established foundation for what can be retrieved, you can begin to expand out and see what's currently residing in cache and get the execution plan and query text for these objects. I'll show where you can get aggregate information for the queries in cache to determine which queries are being accessed most frequently or which is using the most CPU. I'll demonstrate methods for combining this information with XML queries to retrieve Missing Index recommendations from the query optimizer. I'll show how to determine which indexes are being used in your system and which are not. All of this will be focused, not on the DBA, but on the query writer, the developer or database developer that needs information to tune and troubleshoot data access.

## Description:
### Execution plan reuse is one of the most important aspects of building well-performing and scalable SQL Server solutions. But it's also the one that is often overlooked during the design phase and becomes very difficult to troubleshoot later. In this session we will discuss in details the following aspects of SQL Server execution plans: compilation, re-compilation, parameterization, caching, reuse and aging. You will leave this session with full understanding of how to improve your servers performance by increasing execution plan reuse (or how to avoid reuse in case this is necessary).

## Speaker(s): Charley Hanania
## Title: Understanding time zones and using them effectively in your database applications
## Description:
### Applications and companies that used to be extremely localised have gone global! With this is the expectation that applications can handle geography, local languages and Time zone differences pretty much out of the box. Localisation of languages were handled quite a while ago by SQL Server with National Character sets, and now with SQL Server 2008, we've got both the Geography and Time/Time zone related data types and functions to help us get by. Using these in our applications isn't an out of the box condition though, as mapping addresses to locations and then locations to the correct time zone within and without Daylight savings is relative nightmare. Web services such as Bing Maps and Google Maps bring us closer to the mark, but we need to be able to bring this positioning and timing related data into the database to start with! This demo-rich presentation will walk you through the various states of awareness applications tend to have of location and time zoned data, the issues relating to each state of awareness and how to cut through it to enhance the end user experience and interpretation of their data as well as reporting and aggregating of the information using the SQL Server Engine.

## Speaker(s): 
## Title: SQL Server 2008 - Create powerful XML Schema collections to validate your XML documents
## Description:
### XML is getting more widely used both inside and outside SQL Server. Stored procedures and functions that accept XML parameters or generate XML documents are part of almost every database project these days. When information is exchanged in XML format, there needs to be an agreement between the sender and receiver about the structure and content of the XML document. Using an XSD (XML Schema Definition) Schema, you can validate the structure and content of an XML document. SQL Server introduced XML Schema Collections in SQL Server 2005 and added a number of enhancements in SQL Server 2008. An XML data type variable or column that is bound to an XML Schema collection is called TYPED XML. When a TYPED XML column or variable is modified, SQL Server will validate perform the validations defined in the SCHEMA Collection and the operation will succeed only if the validation succeeds. In this session we will discuss SQL Server XML Schema collections and see how to create powerful XML Schema Collections to validate XML documents with diverse structure and content.

## Title: Designing and Building Private SQL Server Clouds
## Description:
### There is no hotter term right now than cloud computing, however, exactly what this means is a mystery to many people. We will begin this session by defining what cloud computing is and the benefits the technology offers the DBA. You may see the benefits of cloud computing, but are not yet comfortable trusting your sensitive data to the nebulous cloud. The goal of this session is to provide you a blueprint to design and build a private cloud, where you can control the server availability and performance reliability, yet still take advantage of the resource elasticity and hardware flexibility of the cloud. We will share how to use the features native to Microsoft Hyper-V and SQL Server 2008 to build a cloud in your data center. Learn how Hyper-V can provide on-demand scalability and improved resource utilization specifically for the unique SQL Server workload characteristics. We will discuss how to use Resource Governor to guarantee predictable performance, as well as, how to automate the allocation of resources based on the servers current performance, and how to contain problem processes. Finally, we will discuss how the Data Collector can be used to provide constant information about the health of the cloud to itself and to the DBA. Throughout the session, we will demonstrate how these ideas work together to create a new SQL Server infrastructure that will change as your needs change.

## Title: SQL Server Consolidation and Virtualization: Myths, Realities and Best Practices
## Description:
### Server consolidation has been pursued for years yet not many companies have been truly successful when it comes to database consolidation. The maturation of virtualization technologies further add to the many considerations users have to deal with in a consolidation project. Each vendor you talk to claims they have the best solution and/or technology for SQL Server consolidation while others are just selling snake oil. Who's right? What exactly is the relationship between consolidation and virtualization? Are the one and the same? If so, then why are there so many different technologies, each employing different strategies? Should I get the biggest server or build a server farm? Is automated server/instance provisioning truly automated? Why do I even start thinking about consolidation and/or virtualization? These are some of the questions that will be answered along with key best practices and caveats learned from dozens of consolidation projects that range from a dozen to over 4000 SQL Server databases. This session will explore key considerations in a consolidation project and common oversights that derail the project. It will also review notes from the field on the various solutions available today, the strengths, weaknesses and what scenarios they are most appropriate for. This session is about what happens after the cool demos and flashy presentations are over and users wake up to the good, bad and ugly realities of consolidation and virtualization.

## Speaker(s): Andy Leonard
## Title: Applied SSIS Design Patterns
## Description:
### "Design Patterns" is more than a trendy buzz phrase; design patterns are a way of breaking down complex development projects into manageable tasks. They lend themselves to several development methodologies and apply to SSIS development. Chances are you're using your own design patterns now! In this spotlight session, Andy Leonard defines design patterns applicable to SSIS, and then demonstrates their use to develop SSIS solutions. The session is designed for those with little or no exposure to design patterns or application development methodologies; but with good experience in SSIS. The goal is to introduce the science, terminology, and philosophy of design patterns to those wishing to learn more; then demonstrate how to leverage the principles just described by applying them to every day SSIS development. Demonstrations will also include migration through the application lifecycle, deployment, and maintenance.

## Speaker(s): Paul Randal
## Title: Understanding Logging and Recovery in SQL Server
## Description:
### Some of the most misunderstood parts of SQL Server are its logging and recovery mechanisms. The fact that the transaction log exists and can cause problems if not managed correctly seems to confound many DBAs. Why is it possible for the transaction log to grow unbounded? Why does it sometimes take so long for the database to come online after a system crash? Why can't logging be turned off completely? Why can't I recover my database properly? Just what is the transaction log and why is it there? In this in-depth session Paul will unravel the mysteries of the transaction log - its architecture and behavior under different recovery models - as well as how logging and recovery work in SQL Server. This is essential knowledge you need for understanding how backup, restore, log-shipping, database mirroring, and other technologies work.

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design
## Description:
### In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently). Properly structured data structures make it easier to work with data in simple SQL statements rather than having to resort to functional programming and cursors.

## Speaker(s): 
## Title: How the Query Optimizer Works
## Description:
### The Query Optimizer is the component of SQL Server that attempts to determine the best way to execute a query by finding an efficient execution plan. This session will show you how a better understanding on how the Query Optimizer works and what information it needs to generate better execution plans, can help you to improve the performance of your databases. Learn about the high level structures of the Query Optimizer and some important factors that are considered during the optimization phase of query processing. See how you can provide SQL Server with appropriate statistics and indexes so it can perform better cardinality estimation and produce an efficient execution plan. Since the SQL Server Query Optimizer is a cost-based optimizer, this information will help it to better estimate the execution plan cost. Finally, although the Query Optimizer almost always selects a good enough execution plan for a query, it may not create an efficient plan for all the possible scenarios. See how you can troubleshoot these issues and how you can use other alternatives like hints or plan guides to force the query optimizer to produce a better execution plan.

## Speaker(s): Andras Belokosztolszki
## Title: Passing Information to SQL Server - Parameters
## Description:
### Stored procedures and functions encapsulate application logic that can be shared and reused in multiple applications. Invoking these stored procedures and functions is seemingly simple, until you need to pass structured data, like arrays of objects, via the fixed number of parameters. For example adding a sales order via a stored procedure with a variable number of order items requires either multiple round trips to the server, or a way to serialize the order items into a single parameter. The first solution is expensive because of network latency, but for the second solution there is no standard approach to do the serialization. In this session we will explore the various methods available in the last three versions of SQL Server for passing and handling parameters, including manipulating comma separated lists, sql_variants, XML, temporary tables, communication tables and table valued parameters.

## Title: Practical Performance Monitoring and Troubleshooting for the graduated beginner but not yet expert.
## Description:
### Are users complaining about slow performance of their SQL Server based applications? Do you know what the 200 rows returned by "SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats" mean? Do you even know where to start when users complains about poor performance (besides adding more RAM)? Performance tuning is a complex subject and many DBAs struggle with the subject. Industry experts that publish articles and books focus on advanced issues when most of the time, even the basics have not been addressed. This session takes a grounds-up approach to performance monitoring and tuning. We will look at the core tenets of designing for performance, key factors that influence performance and how to monitor your SQL Server systems for performance issues. This session is designed to be practical and does not require expert level knowledge of SQL Server. If you are confused with what you've been reading in whitepapers and blogs, or are tired of not knowing what to tell your users/management why performance is poor, this is the session for you.

## Title: Looking Inside the Beast: Dissecting Complex MDX Formulas
## Description:
### Imagine this scenario: you have a difficult MDX-related problem and search for possible solutions. You find a blog with the complete a "solution" to a problem similar to the one you've got—but you can't figure out how the solution works, so you can't adapt it to your specific situation. Or try this scenario: you have a calculation you are sure can be done in MDX but can't get it to give the correct answer, and you can't figure out why. If either of these scenarios ever happens to you, you want to come to this session. You'll learn how to dismantle a complex formula into smaller, testable pieces, and how to see "inside" deeply nested sets or tuples, whether in calculated member formulas, or in cube assignment statements. Along the way, you'll learn some important concepts about how Analysis Services interprets MDX, such as how Named Sets differ from sets embedded in a calculated member, and how filters in the WHERE clause do—and do not—differ from filters in a sub-select query. The session includes not only pure-MDX techniques, but also shows the best way to take advantage of functions from the Analysis Services Stored Procedure (ASSP) project available on CodePlex.

# The DW/BI System Lifecycle Overview the Kimball Approach

## Speaker(s): Warren Thornthwaite
## Title: The DW/BI System Lifecycle Overview the Kimball Approach
## Description:
### Many DW/BI systems struggle and die because the development team was unaware of the range and magnitude of tasks required for success. This session describes the Kimball approach from the best selling Data Warehouse Toolkit, 2nd Ed. (Wiley, 2008). Starting with an enterprise or program view, the lifecycle defines business opportunities from across the organization and works with senior management to identify the top priority opportunities. The core lifecycle project then drills in on business requirements and project definition around the top opportunities. With the business requirements in place, the lifecycle then branches out into three tracks: technical, data and applications. These three tracks make up the core of the design and development effort. The lifecycle flow comes back together when its time to deploy the initial iteration to the business community. The process then loops back to the beginning for another pass with the next priority opportunity and its associated source data set. You can't manage or participate in a project effectively if you don't know what needs to happen in each step, and what the resulting deliverables and dependencies are. You definitely won't be successful if you leave out any significant element of the overall lifecycle.

# Instrumenting, Monitoring and Auditing of SSIS ETL Solutions

## Speaker(s): Davide Mauri
## Title: Instrumenting, Monitoring and Auditing of SSIS ETL Solutions
## Description:
### Have you ever been struck by the lack of detailed logging available within SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages? If the answer to this question is yes, then you are probably a seasoned Business Intelligence solutions builder. The packages that make up your solutions probably contain extra code to facilitate effective monitoring, control and profiling. However, increasingly, SSIS is being used to unify data found on disparate yet related transactional systems. The batch processes that perform this activity thus become a vital part of the information processing ecosystem. These need to be monitored and profiled in the same way as formal BI solutions but often the resources available are much more meager. What do you do when something goes wrong and the functionality of the packages is not transparent via internal state reporting. This session will introduce you to an improved version of DTExec. By passing the appropriate state flags it can reveal the internal activity of packages without having to make any changes to the packages themselves.

## Speaker(s): Plamen Ratchev
## Title: Panel Discussion: SQL Injection
## Description:
### Are your SQL Servers and databases safe from SQL injection attacks? There are increasing reports of data being compromised by hackers. Are the defences against SQL injection best left to the SQL Server administrators? Or should they be left to application developers? How do administrators and developers best coordinate their defensive efforts? What are the ''best'' defenses? How do the attackers approach attacking a server? Should we just stop using dynamic SQL? In this lively panel discussion, SQL Experts Arnie Rowland, Adam Machanic, Peter DeBetta, Plamen Ratchev, Andrew Novick, and Rob Boek will discuss the pros and cons of filtering, rules, exception handling, blacklisting, parameterization, dynamic SQL, and minimal attack vectors. We will explore the questions of "Who is responsible?", "How did it happen to us?", "How to prevent being a victim?", and "We've been hit, now what?" You are likely to hear disagreements and differing opinions, great suggestions, horror stories, and lots of good information. You don't want to miss this session!

# SQL Server Efficiencies: Sparse Columns and Filtered Indexes
#### [Back to calendar](#id-727)
Event Date: 04-11-2009 16:30 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application Development
## Speaker(s): Don Kiely
## Title: SQL Server Efficiencies: Sparse Columns and Filtered Indexes
## Description:
### One of the tools that Microsoft provides to help minimize data storage sizes in SQL Server 2008 is sparse columns. Sparse columns provide an efficient way to store data that is predominantly null by requiring no disk storage space for the null values. This sounds great, but there is a cost: in a field marked as sparse, the non-null data takes up a bit more storage space than if the field weren't sparse, either two or four additional bytes depending on the data type of the field. A new feature in SQL Server 2008 that is useful with sparse columns although usable even if a table doesn't have sparse columns is filtered indexes. This is an index with a WHERE clause that allows you to index only a subset of the rows in a table. The index favors a subset of the data in the table, which is very useful with sparse columns because most of the data in the field is null. You can create a filtered index on the sparse column that includes only the non-null data. Doing so optimizes the use of tables with sparse columns. This session will explore both of these great new features that can raise the efficiency of your databases to new levels, both when used together and used apart.

## Speaker(s): Kimberly Tripp
## Title: SQL Server Covering: Concepts, Concerns, & Costs
## Description:
### Covering—using an index to cover a query—is one of the most important tuning strategies possible in SQL Server. In fact, over the past few releases many index tuning features target specifically this—covering. SQL Server 7.0/2000 started the trend with indexed views, SQL Server 2005 added “INCLUDE” to allow non-key columns to be “included” in an index and SQL Server 2008 adds filtered indexes into the mix. In this session, we'll discuss the pros and cons of covering, the different strategies possible to achieve it, when it's a good idea to consider covering and when it's a must! This session focuses on tips and tricks for specific types of queries as well as general best practices to determine what’s best to cover. This session is filled with demos – and tips you can implement immediately. If you have critical queries that just don’t perform to your expectations, this session is for you!

## Speaker(s): Paul Nielsen
## Title: Nordic - turn SQL Server into an Object Db
## Description:
### Objects and databases don't mix well. But, Nordic is a CodePlex open source T-SQL code-gen project that fully emulates object orientation within SQL Server, supporting class/attribute inheritance, workflow state w/inheritance, and associations with workflow state dependencies and inheritance. Associations with inheritance is very significant feature it takes the 2D relational model and makes it 3D - all inside that database without Entity Framework. Adding workflow state to associations is like adding business logic to foreign keys without any code. Using a generic .Net UI to engage the data, Nordic is makes it easy to model and build an object/relational database with a clean database abstraction layer. And its fast. In this session Paul demos the Nordic UI, walks though the stored procedure calls, and discusses how to design an object database using SQL Server.

## Speaker(s): 
## Title: Creative Approaches to Large Dimensions in Analysis Services
## Description:
### If you have worked with large dimensions in Analysis Services—that is, dimensions with roughly a million or more members—you have undoubtedly worked to optimize query performance. All too often, performance tuning results in a query improvement of perhaps 5-10%, even after investing countless hours fine-tuning server settings or thousands of dollars on hardware. This session presents several real-world situations where sluggish query performance improved by orders of magnitude, not as the result of adjusting server settings nor as the result of adding hardware, but as the result of applying an unorthodox design to one or more large dimensions—sometimes by intentionally violating "best practice" guidelines. The primary goal of the session is not to give you a specific solution to your precise scenario—although that would indeed be fortuitous—but rather to stimulate new ideas about ways you can approach your large dimensions. Likewise, the session does not focus on the complex and esoteric, but on the pragmatic and productive, even include simple dimension properties that often merely go unnoticed.

## Speaker(s): Warren Thornthwaite
## Title: Kimball Approach Dimensional Modeling Across SQL Server and SSAS
## Description:
### A well designed dimensional model provides the best performing, most flexible, and most easily understood data foundation for the DW/BI system. The dimensional model underlies every successful Microsoft-based DW/BI project. This is true both for the relational platform, leveraging the Star Join optimization in SQL Server 2008 database engine, and in Analysis Services which was fundamentally re-architected in 2005 to support true dimensional models. This session starts with a review of the core concepts of dimensional modeling and explores most of the basic design patterns. We'll present a simple spreadsheet that you can use to design and build your relational dimensional model. We''ll then talk through how to transpose that model into the Analysis Services environment. We'll also talk about why this two-tier data architecture with the dimensional model in both the relational database and in SSAS is mandatory for long term success.

## Description:
### SQL Service Broker (SSB) ships with SQL Server 2005 and 2008. Microsoft continues to invest in enhancing SSB. It provides high-performance, exactly-once, messaging deeply integrated with the SQL Engine. In SSB, Services are configured to reside within a deployed SQL engine. A service may initiate a light-weight dialog to another service and engage in a full-duplex asynchronous messaging interaction. This empowers the SSB application to build a loosely-coupled distributed application that can scale and handle intermittent connectivity. SQL Service Broker is designed to be the foundation of a high-performance enterprise and Internet scale application engines. It is in deployment at many of our largest customers. Bank Itau (Sao Paulo, Brazil) is the largest financial institution in Latin America (16th largest in the world). It has numerous applications running on SQL Server including some processing over 8,400 durable messages per second per instance. MySpace is the largest internet social networking site in the world and currently deploys over 400 SSB instances responsible for all of their traffic. Some of their boxes process over 18,000 transaction and durable messages per second. This talk will explain the business goals for SSB, its architecture, how an application uses SSB, and examine 2 customer implementations contrasting large scale batch processing and real-time online processing.

## Title: Entity Framework 4.0 for DBAs
## Description:
### The Entity Framework enables application developers to define domain models for use in their applications. In this setting the Entity Framework can be used to perform CRUD operations with very expressive query capabilities. This session will take a slightly different perspective on the Entity Framework: instead of discussing only the developers’ domain we will also discuss how the Entity Framework can be a compliment to the general concerns that Database Administrators express. In particular this talk will investigate how the Entity Framework enables developers and DBAs to agree on a conceptual model that acts as a shared contract, providing DBAs control over their database and the entry points into the system that developers utilize by using the Entity Framework’s mapping technology and related features. We will focus on the features that are being added in the Entity Framework 4.0 that provide better integration with the DBA along with a discussion of the integration we are doing between the Entity Framework and other SQL Server such as Reporting Services.

#### [Back to calendar](#id-727)
Event Date: 05-11-2009 13:00 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture
## Speaker(s): Joy Mundy
## Title: ETL: The Linchpin for the Complete Data Warehouse
## Description:
### The Kimball Method always emphasizes the data model as the key to an effective data warehouse / business intelligence system, but the ugly truth is that a lot of power rests with the unappreciated ETL developer. How can we develop ETL systems that dazzle? We can ensure data quality early and often. We can (almost) never break. We can proactively create table and cube partitions. We can even imagine it! Write dynamic ETL components that are kicked off by a business user. The programmability of Integration Services and the entire Microsoft BI product stack makes a SQL Server 2008 data warehouse a good candidate for highly automated excellence in ETL system management. All of these solutions require a bit of coding, but rest assured if Joy can do it, so can you. This session examines several ideas for innovative ETL systems including: - Elegant auditing and data quality checking - Painless partitioning for the RDBMS and Analysis Services - User-initiated processing

## Title: Solid State Disks and SQL 2008: High Availability and Performance
## Description:
### Solid State Disks (SSD) have recently become an extremely hot topic in enterprise storage. Extremely High performance databases have led SSD adoption in the Enterprise and the plummeting price has opened the door for more and more databases to benefit from SSDs. This session will present a survey of the styles of SSD options available today focusing on the type of media (RAM, SLC Flash, MLC Flash) and interface method (SAN, Direct attached, Disk form factor, and PCIe). In order to determine if a particular SQL database can benefit from SSDs its IO profile must be determined. Steps to measure the storage metrics to understand a databases IO profile using perfmon and fn_virtualfilestats (Transact SQL2005) will be presented. The SQLIO benchmarking utility can then be used to evaluate both traditional disk storage and SSD approaches to eliminating IO bottlenecks for a particular IO profile.

## Speaker(s): 
## Title: Understanding Master Data Management and the Benefits
## Description:
### Master data refers to the significant entities of the organization where there is considerable interest in and potential controversy over the build of an enterprise view. Many companies today are codifying efforts to focus on master sets for customer, product, supplier, and other subjects. This is being done to gain efficiencies and direct or indirect bottom-line company improvement. This session will discuss what MDM is, how it is architected into information management environments, and how to outline the business case. The best approach is demonstrating the proposed economic payback of MDM, which requires the translation of efforts into anticipated cash flow. This practical, experience-based session will organize those justification efforts into a structure to demonstrate payback. This tool-agnostic session is recommended for shops in learning, justifying and measuring modes with MDM. The framework and resultant mindshift will help you appropriately champion MDM and get it moving to the benefit of the organization. Agenda What is wrong with how we master data today? What does the world of master data management offer? What are the nuances of master data management architecture? What are the important things to do to achieve MDM success?

## Speaker(s): Victor Isakov
## Title: The Problem with Parallelism...
## Description:
### Will adding more processors to your SQL Server automatically improve question? You would think so... But in certain scenarios you will find that performance will actually be degraded. That queries will be executed poorly, or that there will be more contention problems, or a range of other issues. In this session Victor Isakov will present a number of problems that you may encounter due to a "high" degree of parallelism, and how to manage them. In this day and age where quad-core, quad-processor servers are becoming the norm, it is more important for the DBA to understand how to configure and troubleshoot such SQL Server instances.

## Speaker(s): Denny Cherry
## Title: Storage for the DBA
## Description:
### One of the biggest issues in database performance is around storage. It's also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language. In this session, well be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives. We'll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups. In addition to theory, we'll be looking at an actual EMC SAN which I'll be bringing with me so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.
