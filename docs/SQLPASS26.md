## Title: Data Warehouse Modeling – Making the Right Choices
## Description:
### Data warehouses play a central role in any BI solution. It's the back end upon which everything in years to come will be created. For this reason, it must be rock solid and yet flexible at the same time. To develop such a data warehouse, you must have a clear idea of its architecture, a thorough understanding of the concepts of Measures and Dimensions, and a proven engineered way to build it so that quality and stability can go hand-in-hand with cost reduction and scalability. In this workshop, Thomas Kejser and Davide Mauri will share all the information they learned since they started working with data warehouses, giving you the guidance and tips you need to start your BI project in the best way possible?avoiding errors, making implementation effective and efficient, paving the way for a winning Agile approach, and helping you define how your team should work so that your BI solution will stand the test of time.

You'll learn:

Data warehouse architecture and justification
Agile methodology
Dimensional modeling, including Kimball vs. Inmon, SCD1/SCD2/SCD3, Junk and Degenerate Dimensions, and Huge Dimensions
Best practices, naming conventions, and lessons learned
Loading the data warehous, including loading Dimensions, loading Facts (Full Load, Incremental Load, Partitioned Load)

# This Year's SQL Server Setup Best Practices
#### [Back to calendar](#id-26)
Event Date: 04-11-2013 09:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: This Year's SQL Server Setup Best Practices
## Description:
### You don’t build a lot of SQL Servers, but this year, you need to build one for your company – and it’d better work. You need it to be reliable and fast the very first time. Unfortunately, everything keeps changing, and yesterday’s best practices don’t cover solid state drives, FusionIO, AlwaysOn Availability Groups, and clusters without shared storage. In this all-day session, Microsoft Certified Master Brent Ozar will bring you up to speed. He’ll teach you how to pick storage, when it’s okay to use virtual servers, how to turn business requirements into clustering/mirroring/AlwaysOn/log-shipping, and where to put your data files, log files, and TempDB. This session is for developers and DBAs who need to pick SQL Server hardware and aren’t sure about the options today.

# No More Guessing! An Enlightened Approach to Performance Troubleshooting
#### [Back to calendar](#id-26)
Event Date: 04-11-2013 09:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Adam Machanic
## Title: No More Guessing! An Enlightened Approach to Performance Troubleshooting
## Description:
### Scratching your head, you stare at the screen. Should you rebuild an index? Create a new one? Reboot the server? Why is this query so slow?!? Figuring out performance problems can sometimes feel like fumbling your way through a dark room. Maybe you’ll get lucky and find the right solution?or maybe you’ll stub your toe. Either way, it’s a slow, potentially painful process. Yet finding the root cause of most performance issues is a simple exercise, once you understand where to look and when.

In this full-day seminar, you will learn a proven methodology that can be used to approach virtually any performance problem. Created and refined by Adam Machanic over several years, this strategy leverages core SQL Server performance tools (including dynamic management views, Extended Events, and WMI counters), applying them to various performance troubleshooting techniques (such as waits and queues analysis, baselining, and real-time activity monitoring). Each of these tools and techniques has a unique role, and you will learn to use them cooperatively to quickly and adaptively find the actual cause of performance issues. All of this will be illustrated through demonstrations that will teach you how to drill from high-level problem detection all the way to a specific spot in a query plan or deeper?pinpointing the exact problem and helping you quickly solve it. Attend this seminar to take full control of your databases—and never again stumble blindly through the dimly lit world of performance troubleshooting.

# Performance Tuning with Indexes: Internals and Best Practice
#### [Back to calendar](#id-26)
Event Date: 04-11-2013 09:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Performance Tuning with Indexes: Internals and Best Practice
## Description:
### Indexes allow SQL Server to access your data in the most efficient manner. Understanding exactly how indexes are structured and stored internally can give you a deeper understanding of what indexes will be useful for your queries. And knowing how indexes are useful lets us generalize some best-practice recommendations. In this seminar, we’ll look at the following topics:

Basic index structures, including clustered vs. nonclustered, unique vs. non-unique, and Included columns
Tools for exploring index structures
Index maintenance, including page splits, fragmentation, and defragmentation
Index design considerations, including ANDs/ORs, JOINs, and Composite indexes
Best-practice guidelines
Columnstore index storage
Columnstore index guidelines

# Data, Faster: SQL Server Performance Techniques with SQLCLR
#### [Back to calendar](#id-26)
Event Date: 05-11-2013 10:30 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Adam Machanic
## Title: Data, Faster: SQL Server Performance Techniques with SQLCLR
## Description:
### Sometimes it seems like business users are constantly more demanding: They want more data, more analytics, more insight, and the output needs to be faster, faster, faster. And so we database developers struggle to write ever more complex queries, tune our hardware, carefully choose indexes...and sometimes it’s just not enough. Where do you go when you’ve hit the performance wall? As more and more developers are discovering, a great choice is to make use of SQL Server’s CLR capabilities. User-defined aggregates, table valued functions, and user-defined types are more than just logical constructs; properly applied, they can make complex, logic-driven queries many times faster. This session will show you when and how to use these powerful tools in ways you may not have previously considered. If you’re ready to take your SQL Server development skills to the next level, this session is definitely your starting point.

# SQL Server Internals and Architecture
#### [Back to calendar](#id-26)
Event Date: 05-11-2013 10:30 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration and Deployment
## Speaker(s): Kevin Kline
## Title: SQL Server Internals and Architecture
## Description:
### Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:

-	What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems?
-	What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-	How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-	What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-	What happens during checkpoints?  Lazywrites?
-	How are IOs handled with regards to transaction logs and database?
-	What happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrinks?

This fast paced session will take you through many aspects of the internal operations of SQL Server and, for those topics we don’t cover, will point you to resources where you can get more information.  So strap on your silly, as we cover all these topics and more at speed with tongue planted firmly in cheek!

# Optimizing Data Models in Tabular & PowerPivot
#### [Back to calendar](#id-26)
Event Date: 05-11-2013 10:30 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development and Administration
## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: Optimizing Data Models in Tabular & PowerPivot
## Description:
### Is your new Tabular solution performing at its best? Are you using the best practices to reduce memory footprint, increase query speed and get the best out of the new engine? In this session, we will look at several techniques that can really make the difference in a Tabular solution. Distinct count reduction, join optimizations, condition consolidation, pros and cons of normalized data models, selection of the columns to store in the database are some of the topics covered in this session, which will highlight not only the best practices, but also practices that were best in Multidimensional and became worst in Tabular. As I am used to say: if you know Multidimensional, you need to forget it in order to let the new concepts of Tabular shape your model.

## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Hekaton for the DBA: A Whole New World
## Description:
### SQL Server Hekaton, Microsoft’s new In-Memory table technology to be shipped as part of SQL Server 2014, will completely change the way you think about data management. As a DBA, you will need to analyze your memory and storage needs completely differently. All Hekaton data is always stored in memory, and the data stored on disk is basically just a REDO log used to regenerate the contents of your memory-optimized tables. This session will show you the in-memory architecture for your Hekaton data and indexes and discuss what gets written to disk during checkpoints, as well as what gets logged. You will also learn how the recovery process recreates your Hekaton tables.

## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Powerful T-SQL Improvements that Reduce Query Complexity
## Description:
### We’ve all dealt with nightmare queries: huge, twisted monsters that somehow work, despite being ugly and unmanageable. The time has come to tame these beasts, and the solution is available now, in SQL Server 2012.
New T-SQL functions offer out-of-the-box solutions for many problems that previously required complex workarounds. Paging, Running totals, Moving aggregates, YTD, and much more comes at the power of your fingertips in SQL Server 2012. The only thing you need to do is learn the syntax. And that is exactly what this session is all about: a thorough description and explanation of the syntax, and loads of demos to demonstrate how you can use all these new features.
Attend this session to boldly take SQL Server where it has never gone before!

# Using Your Brain to Beat SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#id-26)
Event Date: 05-11-2013 15:15 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Adam Machanic
## Title: Using Your Brain to Beat SQL Server
## Description:
### Thought you did everything right? Indexes are finely tuned. Statistics are fully scanned and updated. Your nice big server seems to have plenty of power. But you are still not getting the performance you expect from SQL Server. Why is the optimiser failing you?

SQL Server's query optimizer, often very good at coming up with decently-performing plans, also regularly goes down the wrong path. The problem domain is simply too large and complex for it to adequately cover all cases. When the going gets tough, you mind is a better machine for the job. So don't trust optimisation to a mere piece of code! In this session we will teach you how to recognise various real world cases where the optimiser fails. We will show you why these queries aren't performing as well as they should and how to work around the optimiser's lack of insight. You will learn to turn your brain into a better query optimiser and make your queries faster than you thought possible.

## Speaker(s): Klaus Aschenbrenner
## Title: Index Impact Workload Analysis
## Description:
### Should we add this additional index, should we modify existing ones, or does it make sense to drop unused (?) indexes to improve workload performance? A lot of different questions, but finding correct, profound answers is very hard and difficult. In this session you will learn a proven approach how you can identify if an index change was a good or bad one. We will take a real SQL Server OLTP workload, establish a baseline against it, and use that baseline together with some tools to determine if index changes should be applied to our production databases, or not. After attending this session, it is very easy for you to apply the same techniques to your production environment.

## Title: The Day After Tomorrow: Why you need to baseline
## Description:
### Ensuring peak SQL Server performance isn’t always easy and requires a lot of work on the part of the DBA. To maintain the best-possible performance, you need to make sure you’re monitoring the right things. But how do you know if the figures you’re seeing are good or bad? Baseline comparisons can help, and in this educational session, SQL Server expert Richard Douglas will show you how to get the most from them. Richard will explain what a baseline is, why and when you need to take one, and how you can create one. You’ll also learn about a number of native Windows and SQL Server tools that will allow you to do just that.

Event Date: 06-11-2013 11:45 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development and Administration
## Speaker(s): Davide Mauri
## Title: Automating DWH Patterns through Metadata
## Description:
### Something around 80% of the work of a BI solution is spent building the ETL phase. ETL is also usually a quite big challenge, but it can be easily broken down into two - at least - separated processes. One is strictly related to business modeling, and therefore cannot be replicated by definition. The other one is a purely technical processes, always the same regardless of the reality in which we operate, and as so can then be deeply automated.
In this session we will look at the well-known patterns to solve common problems and how they can automated, with the help of specific tools and techniques that utilizes metadata in order to reduce development time and bugs to a minimum. The presented engineered will enable the adoption on an Agile approach to your BI solution.

## Speaker(s): Tim Peterson
## Title: Use the Power of Analytical Hierarchies in Your Cubes
## Description:
### Analytical hierarchies bring the questions of the business analyst into the structure of the cubes. This session examines the power of analytical hierarchies, looking specifically at the opportunities provided by calculation hierarchies.

Calculation hierarchies give you the ability to build business models into your cubes. As the insights of business analysts are built into cube calculations, higher levels of insights can be achieved.

Analytical hierarchies can model forecasts and scenarios. They organize multidimensional data into meaningful patterns. Some of the most popular analytical hierarchies provide insight along the time dimension:

Current Period Calculations
Relative Date Period Calculations
Period To Date and Rolling Average Calculations
Comparison, Ratio, and Forecasting Calculations

This session demonstrates all of these types of analytical hierarchies and shows you how you can design and create the specific analytical hierarchies that you need for your organization.
