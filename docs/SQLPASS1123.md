## Title: Giving Feedback: How to Effectively Communicate to your Employees
## Description:
### As a manager or team leader giving effective feedback is vital to the success of projects. Managers often ascend the hierarchy due to their technical skill set, but rarely learn ways to successfully communicate with their team. 

In this session, we will discuss soft skills and best practices to give feedback. We’ll learn the essentials for an interaction and how to prepare for tough conversations. Using sample coaching conversations, we’ll run through examples to help you prepare for your next tough dialog. Whether it is a simple coaching sit down, or performance improvement related, and even disciplinary actions, learn how to handle confrontation tactfully.

## Title: Query Store Best Practices
## Description:
### Almost every time I present on the topic of Query Store, someone asks about the performance overhead of implementing it.  It's not just about configuration options; there are aspects related to a system’s workload that are vital to understand and consider.  In this session we will discuss the best practices for Query Store – not just the what, but also the why.  We’ll also talk about problematic workloads and what you can do to make Query Store an option for your solution.  Whether you're running Azure SQL, or SQL Server 2016 or higher on-prem, it's worth taking the time to understand all the factors to optimize your use of Query Store.

## Speaker(s): Leslie Andrews
## Title: So, You Want to Be an Azure Data Engineer When You Grow Up?
## Description:
### With changes to the Microsoft certifications into the new Role based system, the traditional database knowledge isn't quite enough to become a Data Engineer. Due to the advent of the Azure systems database, professionals have to learn more than administration, modeling, and query tuning. 

In this session, we will discuss what a Data Engineer needs to know regarding storage and security, some of the duties one might be expected to perform (such as devops and automation), and resources for additional information for helping you pass the certification exams that will take your career to the next level.

If you run any of these services on an on-premise SQL Server instance or on an Amazon EC2 instance, you can save on costs by supporting them directly on Amazon RDS for SQL Server and consolidating these services to run on the same RDS database instance that hosts your SQL Server database.

This session will dive deep the Relational Database Service (RDS) offering of Microsoft Business Intelligence as well as how to configure RDS instances for each BI component. We will review options for security, availability, and reliability operations provided for each offering.

## Title: 10 Cloudy Questions to Ask Before Migrating Your SQL Server
## Description:
### Cloud adoption of database-related services continues to accelerate, but the choices for which service to select – IaaS, DBaaS, and PaaS – all impact the features available to your applications. Selecting a service is a critical first step in the migration process, and selecting poorly can lead to cost overruns and significant time spent going down the wrong path. The questions you do not ask or consider prior to a migration can make or break your cloud experience. The most important ten questions to answer, such as your availability requirements, database-level dependencies, migration strategies, and other critical concerns, will all be discussed so that you are ready to move to the cloud with confidence in your platform of choice.

## Description:
### In today’s marketplace, moving to the public Cloud is a familiar and consistent trend within the SQL Server community. But which cloud provider do you choose? After all there are different AWS instances each with their own distinctive features. Migrations to the cloud are only going to gain greater momentum as organizations grapple with their on-premises alternatives.  

Recent cloud breaches may have some organizations hesitant to take the leap and move to the cloud, however market-leading cloud providers are making every attempt in adhering to compliance guidelines while boosting their security framework and reliability offerings. They are also becoming more competitive by managing their cost more effectively.  

For both homogeneous and heterogeneous migrations, planning plays a critical role in moving to the cloud. Preparing a checklist and asking the right questions to stakeholders lays the groundwork in this planning. There are different methods to migrate databases from on-premises to the AWS cloud.  

In this presentation, we will discuss various methods and explain the advantages and disadvantages of using each method. We’ll also showcase the surprises and pitfalls to avoid as we venture into the process. 

Learn more on what trends you can expect to see, what the future holds for cloud, and see how the DBA role and their responsibilities are undergoing changes to fit into the new profile necessary in managing the cloud framework.

## Description:
### You spent days on discovery, data sources, cleansing, ETL/ELT, and modeling. Now you need to put the information on the screen and make it easy for the end user to consume and understand. There are some very important Do’s and Don’ts in digital story telling that can mean the difference between an impactful and easy-to-use report that tells a story, and one that users struggle with understanding the message.  We’re not just talking about pie charts and visuals, but about the correct and efficient use of color, contrast, white space, and layout.  We’re talking about creating enterprise class collections of reports with a unifying and professional look and feel regardless of who created the report.

# Splitting Up Your Work in Chunks
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1123)
Event Date: 10-11-2020 00:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Development
## Speaker(s): Erland Sommarskog
## Title: Splitting Up Your Work in Chunks
## Description:
### We all know that we should write set-based statements and that we should avoid loops. However, sometimes operating all data at once may be too much and it is better to split up the work into chunks, leading to a combination of set-based statements and loops.

This session starts with a discussion of some scenarios where chunking may come into play. The session then goes into important techniques you need to employ to get good performance when you implement chunking – done wrong, chunking can lead to worse performance than without chunking. The session also discusses other things you need to consider when you implement chunking: How is the application affected? How to restart an interrupted chunking operation? What to consider when it comes to testing? 

The last section demonstrates how you can use chunking to improve performance in situations where you cannot use set-based statements, because you cannot accept that you lose all rows as a result of a few rows failing to load.

## Speaker(s): Adam Anderson
## Title: Advanced Development Pipelines
## Description:
### Learning how to build and release databases one at a time is a great start. After all, you have to learn to walk before you run. In this session, we will do a 5-minute warm up and then we will be off and running. 

We will start by creating a multi-threaded build that includes a database and a .NET application and learn about build dependencies while we're at it. After we are warmed up, we will attempt a database build that is tightly coupled with other databases and throw in using a container as the build agent for good measure. Lastly, we will finish strong with environment automation and management. This may seem like a lot, and it is, but with training and dedication anything is possible.

# Statistics Techniques Can Fix Tough Performance Issues
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1123)
Event Date: 10-11-2020 00:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker(s): Vern Rabe
## Title: Statistics Techniques Can Fix Tough Performance Issues
## Description:
### Do you have some slow queries that you can’t seem to speed up? Maybe it’s due to statistics. The optimizer does a great job of coming up with an execution plan that is fast, but only when it is given good information to work with, and the query optimization statistics are probably the most important information at its disposal.
The statistics that are automatic created and maintained are usually sufficient for the optimizer to come up with a good plan. But there are exceptions. In this session, after a brief overview of what statistics are, we’ll see how filtered statistics can help performance against very large tables (especially with skewed data), how the statistics on computed columns can help, when and how to override the default sample size, how to identify and fix performance problems due to stale statistics on ascending keys, how manually created statistics can help queries against correlated columns, and more. With these techniques you WILL improve query performance.

## Speaker(s): Brandon Leach
## Title: SQL Server Configuration And Deployment With Powershell DSC
## Description:
### Provisioning a new SQL Server instance is not just about the install.  Often times we have to go through a litany of post configuration steps that must be performed.  When we do this manually we are far more likely to make mistakes.  

Additionally configuration can change over time.  These changes need to be managed and unexpected changes can cause issues. Can you say for certain that your systems are configured exactly as you expect?

Desired State Configuration (DSC) in Powershell is a key tool for moving towards a culture of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in a windows environment. It can help make your deployments more consistent while speeding them up. Additionally it can help you monitor, report, and correct configuration drift automatically. 

In this session we will go over the core principles of Infrastructure as Code, the various components of DSC, how to set up a pull server. We will also use DSC to deploy and setup a two replica availability group with the push of a button.

## Title: Give Power [BI] to the People - Securely Share Your Insights
## Description:
### Every organization is a data organization and you must collaborate on data to stay on track. Sharing insights from within Power BI will give you an advantage and help steer your organization in the right direction.
However there are some pitfalls with sharing - if you don’t know your options and set proper governance, you could be on your way to a data breach or giving your private information to the competition.

In this session, you will get a short introduction to Power BI and understand where data resides, why and how you should share with your colleagues and outside partners, and get a strategy for setting governance for your data. You will walk away with the outline of a governance plan, an understanding of your sharing options, and the sharing settings you should immediately turn off.

## Title: Data Modernization 
## Description:
### Businesses today need to be ‘data driven’ to succeed, that is no understatement. Those businesses that can best utilize data are the ones that can better serve their customers, out-compete their competitors and increase their operational efficiency. However, to be data driven, you need to be able to “mine out the gold” so to speak of all your available data while it is still valuable. 

Key to this is Data Modernization. Data Modernization starts with the recognition that existing systems, architectures and processes may not be sufficient to handle the requirements of a data-driven enterprise, and that new innovative solutions need to be adopted to succeed. While the replacement of legacy technology is not a new phenomenon, the particular sets of pressure points, leading to the current wave of modernization, are. 

In this session we will delve into the very real pressures pushing enterprises down the path of data modernization, and approaches to achieving this goal with success.

## Title: Do You Feel the Need… the Need for Speed in Your SQL Server Database? Are You Frustrated With Your Tuning Efforts?
## Description:
### Query tuning is key to peak performance in SQL Server databases. However, lots of developers and DBAs constantly struggle to pinpoint the root cause of performance issues and spend way too much time in trying to fix them. During this webinar, we’ll show you how Quest Foglight can quickly help you find which queries to focus on and fix. By utilizing Forglight’s multi-dimensional Performance Investigator and Quest’s SQL Optimizer, you  can quickly rewrite the query or discover the best index to use.

Regardless of the complexity of your database or your skill level, this systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path with no guessing, saving countless hours of tuning queries and optimizing performance of your SQL Server databases.

To illustrate how Foglight can overcome many challenges of tuning, we’ll demonstrate how to:
•	Effectively use wait types to quickly identify bottlenecks and get clues on the best tuning approach
•	Quickly identify inefficient operations through review of query execution plans
•	Use SQL Optimizer to rewrite the query to get  the best execution plan

## Speaker(s): Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: Data Warehouse Automation Using Agile Methods
## Description:
### Agile development means being able to accomplish goals in short time frames. In order to do this with a data warehouse, there are two issues. First is being able to deliver results to the business quickly. Second is having an architecture to execute shorter deliveries. The pattern of Data Vault design provides the architecture. There are some bumps in the road for developers if they are not familiar with this design. This is no different than the change of mind going from database normalization to dimensional modeling. The dimensional model can still be used as an information mart on top of the data vault.
The real funs begins when metadata (data about data) is used to automate some processes. The metadata can use the repeatable patterns for structured ETL or ELT whether using T-SQL or SSIS. The end result will include documentation for management from this metadata.

## Speaker(s): Janis Griffin
## Title: A Deep Dive into Execution Plans & How to Use Them!
## Description:
### The SQL Server Query Optimizer creates an execution plan for every statement running in the database. Since SQL is a declarative language, we describe what data we want to see, then the SQL Server Optimizer figures out a plan to retrieve that data efficiently.  However, sometimes the Optimizer chooses a bad query plan which not only makes the query run slow, but eats up resources so other processing can’t get done.  

This presentation will show how to read and fine tune the query plan for better performance. We’ll quickly go over the different types of execution plans and when to use them. We’ll examine the different operators, their statistics and costs, then determine which steps to focus on tuning.  Finally, several trouble shooting techniques will be shown so you can increase your tuning skills.

# Deadlocks. Understanding and Troubleshooting.

## Speaker(s): Denis Reznik
## Title: Deadlocks. Understanding and Troubleshooting.
## Description:
### I would not reveal a secret if I said that the deadlock is not fun at all. The definition of deadlock is straightforward and quite clear: This is an exceptional situation when two concurrent queries request the same resources but in a different order. Unfortunately, in real life, deadlocks often are more complex and unobvious. 

One of the rules, which I always keep in mind, sounds: "You can not design a database, in which deadlock can't happen". So, we should deal with them. The algorithm is simple: 
1. Catch the deadlock
2. Find the root cause
3. Design and implement a solution. 
In practice, these steps can be tricky and may require different types of analysis. 

In this session, we will remind the concepts of locks and transaction isolation levels, and then look at ten various deadlocks scenarios and find the root cause of the deadlocks. After that, you will see how easy solution searching could be if we did a good job on the previous step.

## Speaker(s): Taiob Ali
## Title: Think Like the Cardinality Estimator
## Description:
### SQL Server uses a phase during query optimization, called cardinality estimation (CE). This process makes estimates bases on the statistics as to how many rows flow from one query plan iterator to the next. Knowing how CE generates these numbers will enable you to write better TSQL code and, in turn, influence the type of physical operations during query execution. 

Based on that estimated rows, the query processor decides how to access an object, which physical join to use, how to sort the data. Do you know how the CE generates these numbers? What happens when you have multiple predicates, range predicates, variable values that are 'NOT KNOWN' to the optimizer, or you have predicate values increasing in ascending order? Do you know what will happen if your predicate is using a value that is outside of the histogram range?

In this session, I will show you how CE estimates in all these scenarios, and you will walk out better equipped to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.

## Speaker(s): Edward Pollack
## Title: Improving Analytics Performance With Columnstore Indexes
## Description:
### Administrators and analysts often struggle with the storage and maintenance of reporting and analytics data.  Traditional rowstore tables do not scale well when data is measured in billions of rows.

Columnstore indexes provide a speedy and convenient way to store OLAP data within SQL Server.  Compression allows the data to be much smaller than other storage methods, allowing for faster reads.  Column metadata provides the tools needed for SQL Server to be able to service queries over massive data sets quickly and efficiently.

The basics of columnstore indexes allow an administrator to improve the performance of analytics, but there is much more to learn!  Understanding the internals of columnstore indexes allows querying to be even more efficient.

Columnstore indexes have evolved greatly since their introduction in SQL Server 2012.  This presentation explores this feature in SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2019 and how its newest features can turbo-charge your analytics workloads!

## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Execution Pans ... Where Do I Start?
## Description:
### SQL (the language) is not a third generation language, where the developer tells the computer every step it needs to take. It is a declarative language that specifies the required results. SQL Server itself will figure out what steps it takes to get to those results. Most of the time, that works very well.

But sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes a query takes too much time. You need to find out why, so you can fix it. That’s where the execution plan comes in. In the execution plan, SQL Server exposes exactly which steps it took for your query, so you can see why it’s slow.

However, execution plans can be daunting to the uninitiated. Especially for complex queries. Where do you even start?

In this session you will learn how to obtain execution plans. and how to start reading and understanding them.

## Speaker(s): Dave Bland
## Title: The DBA Guide to Surviving an Audit
## Description:
### So the best day a DBA can have is when the auditors are calling you asking for information. Right? If you are like me, that would not be considered the best day.  However, it does not have to be a bad day either. Audits are a necessary part of our job. Since we must have them, it would be nice to have a plan before they walk in the door.  
That is what this session is about, developing that plan! There are many common bits of information auditors ask for every audit. This information can include providing evidence of backups, key job failures and evidence of who has elevated access to key financial databases. This is just the beginning.  Auditors have also asked for information about SSRS, SSAS and SSIS. This session we will use Azure Data Studio Notebooks to retrieve much of the information you may need during an audit.  When pulling the evidence, the auditors are asking for, it is also important to know what to say and even more important, what not to say.

## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: Deploying Availability Groups in Virtualized Architectures
## Description:
### Fewer and fewer are deploying SQL Server on physical hardware. Most are virtualizing on premises, up in a public cloud with IaaS virtual machines, or in a hybrid architecture that spans on premises and the cloud. Where you configure SQL Server does not change the fact it needs to be highly available, and Always On Availability Groups (AGs) are still a great option. This session will cover the best practices, tips, tricks, and gotchas on how to plan and deploy AGs when you are using VMware, Hyper-V, Azure, AWS, and GCP.

## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Execution Plans in Depth
## Description:
### For troubleshooting slow queries, looking at the execution plan is a good starting point. However, just looking at the plan does not always help. Sometimes, you need to dig deeper.

In this full-day, pre-con session, you will learn everything you need to take your understanding of execution plans to the next level. For most operators you'll find in execution plans, we will look at the inner workings and properties that affect their behaviour. We will also look at how the operators within a plan interact with each other. This will increase your understanding on why the optimizer picks a plan, and what you can do to make it pick a better plan.

In addition to explaining most operators, we will also look at how these operators interact. This will help you understand which areas in complex execution plans can cause performance issues. If you have seen some execution plans but feel you need to bring your understanding to the next level, then this pre-con session is for you!

## Speaker(s): Pinal Dave
## Title: Neutralize Troublesome SQL Server Indexes - Fun Stories & Demos
## Description:
### SQL Server Indexes are not always as much as helpful as we like to think. Often they work against our overall server performance. In this session, we will see some troublemaking scenarios and their workarounds. 
Slow Running Queries are the most common problem that developers face while working with SQL Server. While it is easy to blame SQL Server for unsatisfactory performance, the issue often persists with the way queries have been written, and how Indexes has been set up. The session will focus on the ways of identifying problems that slow down SQL Server, and Indexing tricks to fix them. We will see a few different scenarios where indexes will actually negatively affect the performance of queries. By removing some of the indexes, we can easily improve the performance of overall system. 
This is a very unique session and will explore the dark side of indexes and its resolutions. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately.

# A Self-Tuning Fill Factor Technique for SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1123)
Event Date: 10-11-2020 00:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker(s): Mike Byrd
## Title: A Self-Tuning Fill Factor Technique for SQL Server
## Description:
### Have you ever created an index and wondered what to specify for your fill factor? Usually most of us never ever give it a worry and just leave it at the default value = 0 (actually this is a synonym for 100). Recently I’ve discovered a technique that establishes a “near” optimum fill factor value for every index in a database. I say “near” because it may not always derive the perfect fill factor, but will get you close. We will look closely at the T-SQL for this technique to see how the proof of concept was developed for a very active OLTP database. The code "tunes" on both index fragmentation and bad page splits.  A decrease in overall database wait times of 30% was achieved within 60 days after the tuning was initiated. The tuning is continuous and allows for changes in data skew as well as evolving application interactions with the database. This is a real breakthrough for making your indexes and queries perform even better. All code will be available for download.

## Speaker(s): Will Velida
## Title: Machine Learning in C#?! Introduction to ML.NET
## Description:
### If you're a .NET developer, you may be forgiven for thinking that in order to build awesome machine learning applications, you'll need to brush up on your Python skills in order to use ML libraries, or even worse, buy food for that data scientist in your team until they've built an ML model for you.

With the release of ML.NET, this is no longer the case!

In this session, I'll cover what ML.NET is and how you can use it to add machine learning capabilities to your .NET applications. I'll cover the capabilities that the API offers in terms of preparing our data and evaluating our models. I'll also talk about the capabilities that the ML.NET Model builder and how that can simplify how we choose what type of model we want to build and I'll also talk about how we can deploy our models into production.

So ditch that data scientist (in a nice way of course) and come and see how you can leverage your existing .NET skills to use ML.NET to build some interesting machine learning applications!

## Speaker(s): Greg Low
## Title: Make a Real SQL Cloud Transformation, Not Just a Migration
## Description:
### It seems that almost every CIO today is claiming to be starting a “cloud transformation” project, yet while many are doing the “cloud” part, the majority are not actually doing the “transformation” part. While a phased migration might be essential for some, transformation is key to long-term outcomes. This is even more evident when working with SQL Server. It’s important to develop a cloud-first, native-cloud mindset for data and to embrace DevOps for ongoing deployment in order to avoid the common mistakes that lead us data professionals to "just another migration".

## Speaker(s): Brian Hansen
## Title: Get Your Optimizer to Give Up All Its Secrets
## Description:
### You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details of the query optimization process that are not widely known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement into an internal tree structure and then begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  We will also coax SQL Server into outputting structures such as parse trees and memos as well as reams of data about the optimization process.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

#### [Back to calendar](#id-1123)
Event Date: 10-11-2020 00:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing
## Speaker(s): Asgeir Gunnarsson
## Title: What's Going On in My Power BI Environment?
## Description:
### As Power BI is a self-service tool, it can be hard for administrators to monitor it. Power BI is fast improving in this context but there still isn’t a consistent way of monitoring it. There are compliance, governance, performance, and implementation questions to consider. Who is creating content, how is it being distributed, what data is being used, dataset refreshes, who has a trial license, and what report is the most used? These are just some of the questions you as an administrator of Power BI might want to get answers to. 

In this session, we will look at how you can find those answers by monitoring Power BI. We will look at the Power BI Audit log for usage, license, and other audit information. We will look at what the Power BI API can show us about data sets, refresh history, Enterprise Gateway information, premium capacity, and artifact inventory. 

Lastly we will show how you can automate the data collection via Azure and PowerShell and report on the results.

## Speaker(s): Russel Loski
## Title: Consuming API Data using Built in SSIS Components
## Description:
### More and more companies are making their data available not just through flat file downloads but using Application Programming Interfaces (API).  APIs simply define what data the company provides and in what format.  APIs also define what the company needs from you.  We will walk through the NOAA Weather API, building, using an SSIS Script component, the request that the API requires, with the appropriate header and URL.  Then we will then  get the JSON data from NOAA and parse it into a structure from which we can populate a standard SSIS data flow pipeline.  We will do this without any additional components (like JSON.Net, etc). Finally we will output the data using standard script component output columns.  The whole process can be accomplished using SSIS alone.

## Title: Power BI CI/CD with Tabular Editor
## Description:
### Every Business Intelligence team should aspire to fully automate the build, test, and deployment of their BI solution. Something that is not an easy thing to do using the standard tools within the Microsoft BI stack. Thanks to Tabular Editor, however, we now have a tool that enables all the disciplines of continuous integration and delivery - at least for Power BI Datasets and Analysis Services Tabular models.
 
In this session, we will demonstrate an end-to-end Azure BI solution with a Power BI Dataset on top, which is continuously built, tested, and deployed using GIT and Azure DevOps. The secret sauce is Tabular Editor's Command-line Interface, which allows us to make validation deployments, run a Best Practice analysis, and more, directly from within an Azure DevOps pipeline. In Power BI, this is all enabled by the XMLA read/write endpoint. Furthermore, thanks to Tabular Editor's folder serialization, merge conflicts are a thing of the past - even when multiple developers work simultaneously on the same data model!

### TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement. 

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then, we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement. 

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.
