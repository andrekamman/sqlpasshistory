## Title: Embracing Database DevOps through CI/CD
## Description:
### Evolutionary Database Design is the best phrase it can describe database migrations.  But what do we know about database migrations using SQL Server containers?

This session will provide you with answers and guidelines to get you started, to embrace the Database DevOps practice for your organization. You will learn the aspects, methods, and strategies to build and manage your database deployments through CI/CD pipelines with open source tools like Flyway, Kubernetes, and cloud collaborative tools like Azure DevOps.

You will be able to build your first database migration through a CI/CD pipeline at the end of this session.

## Speaker(s): Christine Assaf
## Title: Giving Feedback: How to Effectively Communicate to your Employees
## Description:
### As a manager or team leader giving effective feedback is vital to the success of projects. Managers often ascend the hierarchy due to their technical skill set, but rarely learn ways to successfully communicate with their team. 

In this session, we will discuss soft skills and best practices to give feedback. We’ll learn the essentials for an interaction and how to prepare for tough conversations. Using sample coaching conversations, we’ll run through examples to help you prepare for your next tough dialog. Whether it is a simple coaching sit down, or performance improvement related, and even disciplinary actions, learn how to handle confrontation tactfully.

## Title: Query Store Best Practices
## Description:
### Almost every time I present on the topic of Query Store, someone asks about the performance overhead of implementing it.  It's not just about configuration options; there are aspects related to a system’s workload that are vital to understand and consider.  In this session we will discuss the best practices for Query Store – not just the what, but also the why.  We’ll also talk about problematic workloads and what you can do to make Query Store an option for your solution.  Whether you're running Azure SQL, or SQL Server 2016 or higher on-prem, it's worth taking the time to understand all the factors to optimize your use of Query Store.

## Speaker(s): Richard Waymire, Pooya Amini
## Title: SQL Server Business Intelligence on Amazon RDS
## Description:
### Amazon RDS for SQL Server now supports SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) from the Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI) toolkit. If you run any of these services on an on-premise SQL Server instance or on an Amazon EC2 instance, you can save on costs by supporting them directly on Amazon RDS for SQL Server and consolidating these services to run on the same RDS database instance that hosts your SQL Server database.

This session will dive deep the Relational Database Service (RDS) offering of Microsoft Business Intelligence as well as how to configure RDS instances for each BI component. We will review options for security, availability, and reliability operations provided for each offering.

## Title: Best Practices for Creating Stunning R Visuals in Power BI
## Description:
### A match was made in heaven when Microsoft integrated the R programming in Power BI. One of the reasons why it is such a great match is because Power BI is the premier data visualization tool, and R is an excellent programming language for data visualization. The R programming language enables you to create stunning data visualizations that significantly enhances your data storytelling capabilities in Power BI. 

In this session, I will introduce you to the grammar of graphics concept that is commonly used to develop visualizations in R as well as best practices that should be considered when creating R visuals in Power BI.

## Description:
### Within the Power Platform, there's a data store called Common Data Service (CDS). But why would you use it? You've several hundred connectors allowing you to connect to almost every type of data storage. Well, CDS is an easy way to define and centralize business logic over multiple, interconnected applications handling various types of data.

In this session, we have a good look at CDS and find his strengths and weaknesses. We'll see how to build, ingest and extract data from CDS using demos. When you're using the Power Platform and/or curious about CDS but haven't used it yet, join me at this session.

## Speaker(s): Erin Stellato
## Title: Extending Your Use of Extended Events
## Description:
### If you have made the leap to using Extended Events, chances are you’re using XE to do the exact same thing you used to do in Trace. Maybe you use it to capture query performance over time, or find queries that exceed a specific duration, I/O, or CPU.  Maybe you want to find what login executed a query, or from what workstation or application the query originated.  But Extended Events is so much more than a replacement for Trace; it is a whole new way to think about troubleshooting.
In this session we will discuss the targets, actions, and predicates available in Extended Events and see how you can leverage them to look at problems in SQL Server in ways that you never could before. We will step through as many demos as possible in the time available so you can see why joining #TeamXE was one of the best decisions you ever made.  You’ll walk away with a deeper understanding of Extended Events along with a new methodology for approaching and solving issues in SQL Server.

## Speaker(s): Davide Mauri, Silvano Coriani
## Title: Azure SQL Is The Best Choice For Building Back-End REST API: Discuss!
## Description:
### Modern development is all about being agile, having great performance and scalability. And that’s why Azure SQL is just perfect for that. 
In this session we’ll go through all the reasons why Azure SQL is a great choice for the creation of a backend API that can provide REST API for the most common frontend (mobile, web, anything). From implementing a full CI/CD pipeline for the database, to scaling from a few hundreds to thousands request per second…and more. All using the most loved thing since bread and butter: JSON. And not only that, as security is another big challenge that cannot be overlooked: we’ll also add row-level security to make sure data is served fast and securely. Demo and content heavy, bring developers and coffee.

Event Date: 10-11-2020 00:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: DevOps
## Speaker(s): Brandon Leach
## Title: SQL Server Configuration And Deployment With Powershell DSC
## Description:
### Provisioning a new SQL Server instance is not just about the install.  Often times we have to go through a litany of post configuration steps that must be performed.  When we do this manually we are far more likely to make mistakes.  

Additionally configuration can change over time.  These changes need to be managed and unexpected changes can cause issues. Can you say for certain that your systems are configured exactly as you expect?

Desired State Configuration (DSC) in Powershell is a key tool for moving towards a culture of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in a windows environment. It can help make your deployments more consistent while speeding them up. Additionally it can help you monitor, report, and correct configuration drift automatically. 

In this session we will go over the core principles of Infrastructure as Code, the various components of DSC, how to set up a pull server. We will also use DSC to deploy and setup a two replica availability group with the push of a button.

• Write Queries Faster with AutoHotKey - Nathan Boster

AutoHotKey (AHK) is an open source Windows application used to create macros, hot keys, and "text expansions". Nathan has used this program for years in many different ways, but he finds it especially useful in SQL Server Management Studio. Come and see how AHK can put a library of code snippets--and full queries--at your fingertips.

• How Bad Are Bad Page Splits? - Mike Byrd

Everybody agrees that bad page splits hurt performance, but there is almost no documentation showing actual performance numbers. This session will show an example highlighting the performance degradation encountered during a series of bad page split as well as the ongoing effects of the bad page splits on a SELECT query. Results for this example indicate a potentially larger performance hit than anticipated.

• The Warlock Of Graph-Table Mountain - Chris Hyde

When I was a child I was obsessed with the Fighting Fantasy series of gamebooks, as well as other similar series like Choose Your Own Adventure. Thanks to the new SQL Graph feature introduced in SQL Server 2017, I was able to write an entire game engine to simulate these books, and it took me less than ten minutes to do so! Please join me for this light-hearted introduction to SQL Graph Database to find out how I did it.

• Azure SQL: (IaaS) OR (PaaS) What to use When? - Tariq Younas

## Speaker(s): Dan Mallott
## Title: ORMs and the DBA: How to Keep Both Happy
## Description:
### Talk to any DBA about ORMs and you’ll quickly find out all the things you like about ORMs are what DBAs don’t like. Interestingly enough, most developers I’ve talked to have issues with their ORMs, too. In this session, we’ll explore why ORMs cause such trouble using examples of bad behavior and poor performance with common application patterns. I’ll outline some strategies for mitigating those troubles such as making sure to audit the generated SQL and changing how we write application code to take advantage of how ORMs attack problems under the hood. Lastly, I’ll introduce some tools (and even yet another ORM) that help solve some of the worst of the problems we see in the database when using ORMs.

This talk focuses on the problems ORMs can cause and strategies and solutions to mitigate or solve them, focusing on Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core, since those are the most common ORMs in use in .NET today.

## Speaker(s): Denis Reznik
## Title: Deadlocks. Understanding and Troubleshooting.
## Description:
### I would not reveal a secret if I said that the deadlock is not fun at all. The definition of deadlock is straightforward and quite clear: This is an exceptional situation when two concurrent queries request the same resources but in a different order. Unfortunately, in real life, deadlocks often are more complex and unobvious. 

One of the rules, which I always keep in mind, sounds: "You can not design a database, in which deadlock can't happen". So, we should deal with them. The algorithm is simple: 
1. Catch the deadlock
2. Find the root cause
3. Design and implement a solution. 
In practice, these steps can be tricky and may require different types of analysis. 

In this session, we will remind the concepts of locks and transaction isolation levels, and then look at ten various deadlocks scenarios and find the root cause of the deadlocks. After that, you will see how easy solution searching could be if we did a good job on the previous step.

### In this session, you will see Query Store in action and learn from many real-world examples, the author experienced with Query Store in the last four years in the complex SQL Server production environment with heavy workloads. 

Plan forcing is a very powerful feature, but a bit controversial. This session will demystify it; you’ll see what Query Store exactly does when an execution plan is forced, when the forced plan is respected, and when and why is not, and the most important – when you have to force a plan in the production system and when plan forcing can bring additional troubles. 

We’ll also cover in detail is automatic tuning. You will understand the benefits and potential issues you can have with this feature and how to leverage it with no or minimal risk.

## Title: Data Science: Unsupervised Learning 
## Description:
### In unsupervised, or undirected learning, you don’t have a target variable. You are just fishing in the mud, trying to find some useful general patterns in your data. Market basket analysis is a classic example of unsupervised learning. You try to find which products are purchased together, the association rules. With clustering, you try to find groups of cases, for example typical groups of customers. The most popular clustering methods include hierarchical and K-means clustering. A more advanced algorithm is support vector machines. This one can be also used for supervised learning. This session introduces all of the algorithms mentioned, theoretically and with a lot of demos in R and Python.

## Speaker(s): Edward Pollack
## Title: Improving Analytics Performance With Columnstore Indexes
## Description:
### Administrators and analysts often struggle with the storage and maintenance of reporting and analytics data.  Traditional rowstore tables do not scale well when data is measured in billions of rows.

Columnstore indexes provide a speedy and convenient way to store OLAP data within SQL Server.  Compression allows the data to be much smaller than other storage methods, allowing for faster reads.  Column metadata provides the tools needed for SQL Server to be able to service queries over massive data sets quickly and efficiently.

The basics of columnstore indexes allow an administrator to improve the performance of analytics, but there is much more to learn!  Understanding the internals of columnstore indexes allows querying to be even more efficient.

Columnstore indexes have evolved greatly since their introduction in SQL Server 2012.  This presentation explores this feature in SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2019 and how its newest features can turbo-charge your analytics workloads!

# Execution Pans ... Where Do I Start?
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1123)
Event Date: 10-11-2020 00:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Development
## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Execution Pans ... Where Do I Start?
## Description:
### SQL (the language) is not a third generation language, where the developer tells the computer every step it needs to take. It is a declarative language that specifies the required results. SQL Server itself will figure out what steps it takes to get to those results. Most of the time, that works very well.

But sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes a query takes too much time. You need to find out why, so you can fix it. That’s where the execution plan comes in. In the execution plan, SQL Server exposes exactly which steps it took for your query, so you can see why it’s slow.

However, execution plans can be daunting to the uninitiated. Especially for complex queries. Where do you even start?

In this session you will learn how to obtain execution plans. and how to start reading and understanding them.

### Do you believe the myths that “Third Normal Form is good enough”, or that “Higher Normal Forms are hard to understand”?

Do you believe the people who claim that these statements are myths?

Or do you prefer to form your own opinion?

If you take database design seriously, you cannot afford to miss this session. You will get a clear and easy to understand overview of all the higher Normal Forms: what they are, how to check if they are met, and what consequences their violations can have. This will arm you with the knowledge to reject the myths about higher Normal Forms. But, more important: it will make you a better designer!

First, we will cover the basics of Kubernetes: what is it, who can use it, what can it be used for, why is this different or better than old school deployments through virtual machines? 
Then, we'll show you how to build a Kubernetes cluster and deploy applications into this cluster. Building on those Kubernetes deployment fundamentals, you will also learn how to deploy a SQL Server Big Data Cluster to showcase how you can deploy a complex stateful application in Kubernetes.
We will close the day by working our way through the next gamechanger for deployments: Azure Arc Data Services, a solution that allows us to deploy managed Azure Data Services to any hardware running Kubernetes, including any cloud vendor, on-premises or in the cloud.

You will leave this session with the knowledge, scripts, and tools to get started with Kubernetes and Kubernetes based applications.

## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Execution Plans in Depth
## Description:
### For troubleshooting slow queries, looking at the execution plan is a good starting point. However, just looking at the plan does not always help. Sometimes, you need to dig deeper.

In this full-day, pre-con session, you will learn everything you need to take your understanding of execution plans to the next level. For most operators you'll find in execution plans, we will look at the inner workings and properties that affect their behaviour. We will also look at how the operators within a plan interact with each other. This will increase your understanding on why the optimizer picks a plan, and what you can do to make it pick a better plan.

In addition to explaining most operators, we will also look at how these operators interact. This will help you understand which areas in complex execution plans can cause performance issues. If you have seen some execution plans but feel you need to bring your understanding to the next level, then this pre-con session is for you!

## Speaker(s): Pinal Dave
## Title: Neutralize Troublesome SQL Server Indexes - Fun Stories & Demos
## Description:
### SQL Server Indexes are not always as much as helpful as we like to think. Often they work against our overall server performance. In this session, we will see some troublemaking scenarios and their workarounds. 
Slow Running Queries are the most common problem that developers face while working with SQL Server. While it is easy to blame SQL Server for unsatisfactory performance, the issue often persists with the way queries have been written, and how Indexes has been set up. The session will focus on the ways of identifying problems that slow down SQL Server, and Indexing tricks to fix them. We will see a few different scenarios where indexes will actually negatively affect the performance of queries. By removing some of the indexes, we can easily improve the performance of overall system. 
This is a very unique session and will explore the dark side of indexes and its resolutions. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately.

# A Self-Tuning Fill Factor Technique for SQL Server

Event Date: 10-11-2020 00:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Database Administration
## Speaker(s): Mike Byrd
## Title: A Self-Tuning Fill Factor Technique for SQL Server
## Description:
### Have you ever created an index and wondered what to specify for your fill factor? Usually most of us never ever give it a worry and just leave it at the default value = 0 (actually this is a synonym for 100). Recently I’ve discovered a technique that establishes a “near” optimum fill factor value for every index in a database. I say “near” because it may not always derive the perfect fill factor, but will get you close. We will look closely at the T-SQL for this technique to see how the proof of concept was developed for a very active OLTP database. The code "tunes" on both index fragmentation and bad page splits.  A decrease in overall database wait times of 30% was achieved within 60 days after the tuning was initiated. The tuning is continuous and allows for changes in data skew as well as evolving application interactions with the database. This is a real breakthrough for making your indexes and queries perform even better. All code will be available for download.

## Title: Machine Learning in C#?! Introduction to ML.NET
## Description:
### If you're a .NET developer, you may be forgiven for thinking that in order to build awesome machine learning applications, you'll need to brush up on your Python skills in order to use ML libraries, or even worse, buy food for that data scientist in your team until they've built an ML model for you.

With the release of ML.NET, this is no longer the case!

In this session, I'll cover what ML.NET is and how you can use it to add machine learning capabilities to your .NET applications. I'll cover the capabilities that the API offers in terms of preparing our data and evaluating our models. I'll also talk about the capabilities that the ML.NET Model builder and how that can simplify how we choose what type of model we want to build and I'll also talk about how we can deploy our models into production.

So ditch that data scientist (in a nice way of course) and come and see how you can leverage your existing .NET skills to use ML.NET to build some interesting machine learning applications!

## Title: Power BI Time-Intelligence: Beyond the Basics
## Description:
### Time-Intelligence refers to analyzing and comparing metrics across time and is the most common type of business intelligence reporting. Power BI has a lot of built in capabilities to help you get started but these alone are not enough for most real-world solutions.

The key to mastering time-intelligence in Power BI is a good date table and understanding how to control the filter context. This session will teach you about both!

In this (demo-heavy) session, we’ll quickly review Power BI’s built-in time intelligence capabilities and when you should avoid them! We’ll also cover the importance of a good date table, what attributes it should include, and how it can be leveraged to simplify complex time-intelligence calculations. Finally, we’ll breakdown many of the 40+ DAX time-intelligence functions, showing you how they work under the covers (hint: filter context) and how they can be used in combination to accommodate complex business logic.

### You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details of the query optimization process that are not widely known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement into an internal tree structure and then begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  We will also coax SQL Server into outputting structures such as parse trees and memos as well as reams of data about the optimization process.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.

## Speaker(s): Asgeir Gunnarsson
## Title: What's Going On in My Power BI Environment?
## Description:
### As Power BI is a self-service tool, it can be hard for administrators to monitor it. Power BI is fast improving in this context but there still isn’t a consistent way of monitoring it. There are compliance, governance, performance, and implementation questions to consider. Who is creating content, how is it being distributed, what data is being used, dataset refreshes, who has a trial license, and what report is the most used? These are just some of the questions you as an administrator of Power BI might want to get answers to. 

In this session, we will look at how you can find those answers by monitoring Power BI. We will look at the Power BI Audit log for usage, license, and other audit information. We will look at what the Power BI API can show us about data sets, refresh history, Enterprise Gateway information, premium capacity, and artifact inventory. 

Lastly we will show how you can automate the data collection via Azure and PowerShell and report on the results.

## Title: Consuming API Data using Built in SSIS Components
## Description:
### More and more companies are making their data available not just through flat file downloads but using Application Programming Interfaces (API).  APIs simply define what data the company provides and in what format.  APIs also define what the company needs from you.  We will walk through the NOAA Weather API, building, using an SSIS Script component, the request that the API requires, with the appropriate header and URL.  Then we will then  get the JSON data from NOAA and parse it into a structure from which we can populate a standard SSIS data flow pipeline.  We will do this without any additional components (like JSON.Net, etc). Finally we will output the data using standard script component output columns.  The whole process can be accomplished using SSIS alone.

## Title: Pay Less, Get More. A Guide to SQL Server Licensing
## Description:
### In this session, we will talk about how you can save money by right-licensing SQL Server. Some people consider SQL Server licensing as the “elephant in the room” while others refer to it as “something that no one wants to own, but know they need to sort out.”
SQL Server licensing is a complex beast. It is not always transparent and straight forward to understand what licensing you need. In this session, we will look at how you best license your SQL Servers to get the best return on investment.
We will discuss
What SQL Server editions you need to license
SQL Server and software assurance – why you might need both
How can you buy your licenses?
Licensing models
o	Core based
o	Server+CAL
How to license SQL Server in a virtual environment
Licensing scenarios
o	High availability
o	Application mobility
o	Non-production
o	SQL Server on containers

### DAX (Dynamic Analysis Expressions) is a formula language to enrich imported data with calculated columns, calculated tables and measures in Excel's Data Model, in Power BI, and in Analysis Services Tabular. While the syntax of the language is derived from Excel’s formula language and easy to learn, some of the functions are hiding a real complex semantic. In this talk we will concentrate on numeric calculated columns and measures. You will learn about the differences and advantages of each. You will leave this talk with the knowledge, how to distinguish filter contexts and row contexts and in which cases to use calculated columns and in which cases to use measures.
