## Title: Dipping Your Toes In: Azure Data Lake for DBAs
## Description:
### This session will be a preview of the topic of the session from PASS Summit 2019.

As a data professional, you know what data is, and hopefully know what a lake is too. But what's a Data Lake? This session covers the very basics of Azure Data Lake, and is geared towards those who are familiar with relational databases and also curious about other technologies. Topics covered will include Data Lake storage, security basics, and an introduction to U-SQL, Azure Data Lake's query language. We will finish up with architecture examples showing real-world use cases highlighting Azure Data Lake's strengths. Attend this session to see how Azure Data Lake can complement your existing relational database skills, and give you a great new tool in your data toolbox!

Event Date: 10-09-2019 14:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Allen White
## Title: Do You Know What's In Your Server Inventory?
## Description:
### Before you encounter an emergency situation, you need to know what exactly exists in the servers you manage. Without that, you can't properly recover when something amiss happens. One of the biggest problems after a ransomware attack is reconstructing what existed before it hit. 
In this session we'll go through in detail what you need to know, and one good way to build that list, so you can get back up and running much more quickly.

Event Date: 10-09-2019 17:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Kathi Kellenberger
## Title: Introduction to Azure Machine Learning and Azure AutoML
## Description:
### Machine Learning is becoming a popular skill for database professionals. One way to get started is by taking advantages of services Microsoft provides like Azure Machine Learning Studio and Azure Automated Machine Learning, also called AutoML. Azure Machine Learning is a GUI based development platform for Machine Learning with built-in algorithms, and it’s really easy to deploy your models once you create them. AutoML takes things a step further by actually suggesting which algorithms will perform the best for your data. 

If you want to learn more about Machine Learning and how to take advantage of the services found in Azure, this session is for you!

# Extending DevOps To SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1064)
Event Date: 10-09-2019 18:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: Extending DevOps To SQL Server
## Description:
### Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition. Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck. Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver. Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. In this session Grant explores how you can stay ahead of the competition and discusses what's needed to effectively balance the demand for delivering software faster, while protecting and preserving business critical data.

# Bigger Hardware or Better Code and Design?
#### [Back to calendar](#id-1064)
Event Date: 10-09-2019 19:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Database Administration and Development
## Speaker(s): Jonathan Kehayias
## Title: Bigger Hardware or Better Code and Design?
## Description:
### This session will be a preview of the topic of the session from PASS Summit 2019.

Whether you are running SQL Server in the cloud or on-premise, more hardware often becomes the first answer to performance problems. The cost of scaling up in effort is relatively low, especially in the cloud where changing resource sizes is only a drop down option away, but financially this can quickly become a deal breaker.  Even the fastest hardware won’t keep up with bad design and coding patterns.  

This session will  take a look at many of the new features of SQL Server and how they can best be leveraged for performance tuning your workload.  From In-Memory OLTP to Columnstore Indexes, Query Store, and Extended Events, this session will guide you in finding the source of the problems, and solutions available to make your workload faster and consistently reliable. We’ll even take a look at different alternatives using older features of SQL Server that you may be leaving on the shelf that are a better fit to solving certain kinds of problems.

## Speaker(s): Ed Leighton-Dick
## Title: Database Privacy and Security for Developers
## Description:
### This session will be a preview of the topic of the session from PASS Summit 2019.

Oh, look... another data breach. And another. And another. Hardly a day goes by without a mention of one in the media. Thousands were reported last year, and thousands more didn't make the news. Size, industry, location - none of these are a determining factor anymore. We're all at risk, from malicious actors, insiders, even accidents. And more and more, the weaknesses that are being exploited are found not in the operating system, or the browser, or the network, but in the applications we create and manage.

So, developers... what are you going to do about it? 

In this one-day session, we're going to discuss a range of topics that developers need to know in order to improve their applications' data security and privacy. We'll cover SQL injection, one of the most common exploits over the last twenty years, in-depth, along with other common vulnerabilities. We'll talk about how to apply permissions and encryption properly in SQL Server to directly protect your data. We'll see how the new class of privacy regulations, including Europe's GDPR and California's CCPA, impact your business - no matter where your company is based. And we'll discuss what you're likely to encounter as your company moves toward a culture of data privacy.
