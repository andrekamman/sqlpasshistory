# Secrets of the SQLOS – Leveraging Microsoft SQL Server Internal Operating System for Improved Scalability and Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 10-10-2011 08:30 - Category: Pre-conference Session (7 hours) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration and Deployment
## Speaker(s): Maciej Pilecki
## Title: Secrets of the SQLOS – Leveraging Microsoft SQL Server Internal Operating System for Improved Scalability and Performance
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 Delivered by an expert on the subject, this seminar will make you familiar with one of the most mysterious component of Microsoft SQL Server – its own internal built-in operating system, or SQLOS.
SQLOS is little known and even less documented. It provides operating-system-like services to other components running within the engine and forms a foundation of SQL Server scalability, reliability and performance. As the scalability requirements increase and hardware becomes more and more powerful, SQLOS’ role grows more and more important – and so does our need to understand its internals.
During the course of the day, we will cover all aspects of SQLOS – from the basics of its architecture, through thread scheduling, memory management and Resource Governor, to troubleshooting, Extended Events and advanced SQL Server configuration. Through a series of lectures and demonstrations, you will become familiar with all aspects of its operations and how it enables SQL Server to take advantage of modern, powerful hardware architectures with many CPUs and vast amounts of memory available. You will also learn how to diagnose and troubleshoot advanced performance issues on such servers, including tips and tricks that can make a big difference in performance of high-end servers under heavy load.

Event Date: 10-10-2011 08:30 - Category: Pre-conference Session (7 hours) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration and Deployment
## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: Virtualization and SAN Basics for DBAs
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 These two technologies can make a very big – and very bad – difference in how your SQL Server performs. Wouldn’t it be great if you could get the real, honest lowdown from a virtualization administrator, a SAN administrator, and a DBA? Wouldn’t it be even better if one person had done all three, and could give you the pros and cons of each point of view? That person is Brent Ozar, a Microsoft Certified Master who’s been there and done that.

If you've seen (and liked) Brent's one-hour session on this topic, you'll like the pre-con.  He goes into more depth and detail, showing examples and live demos to prove points about memory, storage, and CPU.  You'll leave ready to challenge your SAN and VMware admins.

# Fixing Queries With Advanced T-SQL Constructs
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 10-10-2011 08:30 - Category: Pre-conference Session (7 hours) - Track: Application and Database Development
## Speaker(s): Rob Farley
## Title: Fixing Queries With Advanced T-SQL Constructs
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 Have you inherited queries that are not your own, and are finding that performance isn’t so great? Removing cursors in favor of set-based queries is useful, but even set-based queries can perform poorly. Understanding the impact that various constructs can have on a query plan could be key to resolving many of these issues.

In this seminar, irrepressible SQL MVP Rob Farley will take a look at some real-life queries and take the audience through examples of constructs that can have significant effects on tuning. This will include complex nested joins, join simplification, procedural functions, SARGability v residuality with predicates, better execution plan reading, start-up parameters, force hints, complex sorting, ORs, effective Dynamic SQL, GROUP BY v DISTINCT, unique indexes, temporary tables, APPLY considerations, and more. You'll discover profoundness in things you thought you knew, and you'll even see when a covering index that returns a single row can be a bad thing.

This will be a day spent in Management Studio, not PowerPoint. If you want to know how to persuade the Query Optimizer to do a better job of running your query, this day is for you. The examples will apply to a variety of versions, with most of it being useful even in a SQL 2005 environment.

# All about Execution Plans
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 10-10-2011 08:30 - Category: Pre-conference Session (7 hours) - Track: Application and Database Development
## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey, Gail Shaw
## Title: All about Execution Plans
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required

. 

The key to understanding how SQL Server is processing your queries is the execution plan. 



This full day session focuses on the execution plan. We will start right at the beginning and talk about the compile process. We’ll also go over how, and more importantly, why, plans are stored in cache and how they are removed. 



We’ll spend time exploring the key differences between actual and estimated plans, and why those descriptions are more than a little misleading. We’ll also show you assorted methods to obtain a query's execution plan and what the differences and tradeoffs of each are.



A full day class on execution plans would not be complete without spending time learning to reading them. You’ll learn where to find useful information in execution plans, what the common operators are and how to decipher the sometimes cryptic messages the plans are sending to you. We'll also debunk some myths surrounding query operators and execution plans.



All of this is meant to further your understanding of how queries work in order to improve the queries you’re responsible for. With this in mind, we’ll show how you can use execution plans to tune queries. All of the information presented will be taken from real world examples. We’ll build on the information through the day so that at the end, after following us through multiple examples at your own computer, you’ll have a stronger understanding of how to read, interpret and actually use execution plans in your day-to-day job.

Event Date: 11-10-2011 08:30 - Category: Pre-conference Session (7 hours) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration and Deployment
## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: A Deep Dive into AlwaysOn: Failover Clustering and Availability Groups
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 When it comes to the availability landscape, Denali changes the game for SQL Server deployments. There many new enhancements and for traditional failover clustering deployments for instances such as flexible failover policies and multi-site clusters that can and will change the way you plan, deploy, and administer. In addition to the changes to failover clustering, there is a whole new feature: availability groups. Availability groups may enable some scenarios that you have had trouble with in the past, such as using a standby database for reporting and some maintenance. This full day will take a deep dive into these two features and tell you everything you need to know about not only the changes to failover clustering, but the proper way to plan, deploy, and administer availability groups to be successful from day one with Denali. If you do not want a basic "this is failover clustering" or a quick introduction to availability groups, nor do you want just a day of theory but want to see everything live (including combining clustered instances with availability groups to increase availability even more), this day is exactly what you need.

## Speaker(s): Stacia Varga
## Title:  MDX, DAX, and DMX: An Introduction to the Languages of BI 
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 To get the most of the presentation layer tools in the Microsoft BI stack when data sources include cubes, PowerPivot workbooks, and data mining models, you can't rely solely on your T-SQL skills. To produce high-performing reports and analytical tools, you'll need to use other query languages like MDX, DAX, or DMX. In this workshop, you'll learn which languages each presentation layer tool supports and the basic syntax used by each language. You'll also learn how take advantage of query builder tools to help you produce queries until you've developed the proficiency to create more complex queries on your own. In addition, you'll learn how to work with expressions to add calculations to cubes and PowerPivot workbooks, and how to use expressions to customize the appearance of reports, scorecards, and dashboards.

## Speaker(s): Jonathan Kehayias
## Title: Extended Events Deep Dive
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 At PASS 2010 after the public release of CTP1 of SQL Server Denali, the product team demonstrated a replacement for SQL Profiler built on top of Extended Events.  The writing is on the wall for SQL Trace and the future of diagnostic profiling in SQL Server is Extended Events. In this workshop you will learn Extended Events from the ground up; from the original implementation in SQL Server 2008 to the enhancements that have been made in SQL Server Denali that redefine data collection for troubleshooting in SQL Server. 


Extended Events provide more information about the operations of SQL Server than have ever before been available in the product.  Unfortunately, there is a significant learning gap between Extended Events and SQL Trace; and the lack of a UI has only made the learning curve that much steeper.  This full-day deep dive workshop will explain the basic concepts of extended events, spin that information into some basic patterns, and build on those patterns to create complex custom functionality that will prepare you for the future.  Learn firsthand from the developer of the SSMS Addin for Extended Events in SQL Server 2008 how to leverage Extended Events in your own environment.

## Title: Building a Microsoft Business Intelligence Platform
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 In this session, you'll learn from author and SQL Server MVP Brian Knight how to build a data warehouse for your company and support it with the Microsoft platform. We'll start with how to design and data model a data warehouse including the system preparation. Then, we'll quickly jump into loading the data warehouse with SSIS. After SSIS, you're ready to roll the data up and provide slice and dice reporting with SSAS. Brian walks through cube development and enrichment with things like key performance indicators, which are essential for your future dashboards. Lastly, Brian covers how to report against the data warehouse with SSRS, including a primer in how to write MDX queries against the SSAS cube. Make sure you bring your own optional laptop as you'll be able to follow Brian in the session as he designs, loads and reports against the data warehouse with you.

# No More Guessing! An Enlightened Approach to Performance Troubleshooting
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 11-10-2011 08:30 - Category: Pre-conference Session (7 hours) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration and Deployment
## Speaker(s): Adam Machanic
## Title: No More Guessing! An Enlightened Approach to Performance Troubleshooting
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 Scratching your head, you stare at the screen. Should you rebuild an index? Create a new one? Reboot the server? Why is this query so slow?!? Figuring out performance problems can sometimes feel like fumbling your way through a dark room. Maybe you’ll get lucky and find the right solution?or maybe you’ll stub your toe. Either way, it’s a slow, potentially painful process. Yet finding the root cause of most performance issues is a simple exercise, once you understand where to look and when. In this full day seminar, you will learn a proven methodology that can be used to approach virtually any performance problem. Created and refined by Adam Machanic over several years, this strategy leverages core SQL Server performance tools (including dynamic management views, Extended Events, and WMI counters), applying them to various performance troubleshooting techniques (such as waits and queues analysis, baselining, and real-time activity monitoring). Each of these tools and techniques has a unique role, and you will learn to use them cooperatively to quickly and adaptively find the actual cause of performance issues. All of this will be illustrated through complete demonstrations that will teach you how to drill from high-level problem detection all the way to specific spot in a query plan or deeper?pinpointing the exact problem and helping you to quickly solve it. Attend this seminar to take full control of your databases—and never again stumble blindly through the dimly lit world of performance troubleshooting.

# Hardware 301: Diving Deeper into Database Hardware
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 12-10-2011 10:15 - Category: Spotlight Session (90 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration and Deployment
## Speaker(s): Glenn Berry
## Title: Hardware 301: Diving Deeper into Database Hardware
## Description:
### Making the right hardware selection decisions is extremely important for database scalability. Having properly sized and configured hardware can both increase application performance and reduce capital expenses dramatically. Unfortunately, there are so many different choices and options available when it comes to selecting hardware and storage subsystems, it is very easy to make bad choices based on outmoded conventional wisdom. This session will give you a framework for how to pick the right hardware and storage subsystem for your workload type. You will learn how to evaluate and compare key hardware components, such as processors, chipsets, and memory. You will also learn how to evaluate and compare different types of storage subsystems for different database workload types. This session will give you the knowledge you need to make sure you get the best performance and scalability possible from your hardware budget!

# Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 12-10-2011 10:15 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration and Deployment
## Speaker(s): Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer
## Description:
### The SQL Server Query Optimizer is a cost-based optimizer: it analyzes a number of candidate execution plans for a given query, estimates the cost of each of these plans, and selects the plan with the lowest cost. In this session I will go into the internals of the Query Optimizer and will show you the steps that it performs in the background covering everything from the time a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated. I’ll show you how the Query Optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, how these plans are stored for the duration of the optimization process, how heuristics are used to limit the number of alternative plans considered, how each candidate plan is also costed, and finally how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs. I will also cover why query optimization is an inherently complex problem and why challenges in some of its most fundamental areas are still being addressed today.

## Speaker(s): Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: Paging DR Availability, You're Wanted In The Recovery Room
## Description:
### There are a lot of options when it comes to disaster recovery and high availability with regards to SQL Server. Most business owners (and many DBA's) lump disaster recovery (DR) & high availability (HA) together and while they do share some pieces, they call for different strategies. Do you pick one or more than one of these options, and what criteria do you use to make the choice? It’s incredibly important that you understand the decision tree that helps you pick the right options(s) for your business and that you can explain the choices clearly to the stakeholders. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but it is complicated.  This presentation will give you a high level understanding of the options, the costs, complexities, & reasons for using each of them.

# What's New in ADO.NET4.5
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 12-10-2011 10:15 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application and Database Development
## Speaker(s): Luiz Santos, Quetzal Bradley
## Title: What's New in ADO.NET4.5
## Description:
### ADO.NET is a set .NET Framework libraries responsible for database access.  It’s composed by two (2) assemblies (System.Data.Dll and System.Data.DataSetExtensions.Dll) and 4 components:
•	SqlClient:  provides native access to SQL Server, SQL Server Express Local Database Runtime and SQL Azure;
•	Managed ODBC:  provides ODBC support for .NET applications;
•	Managed OLEDB:  provides OLEDB support for .NET applications;
•	DataSet:  provides an offline cache for local data manipulation and control binding.
In .NET4, only one feature was added:
•	BigInteger support in DataSet:  BigInteger is a new type introduced by the BCL team in .NET4
And one breaking change was introduced:
•	Implicit transactions:  before .NET4, rollbacks used to happen when the connection was closed.  After .NET4, rollbacks happen when the connection is disposed.
Also, it’s important to note that OracleClient was deprecated.  Currently, the plan of records is to remove it from .NET Framework 5.
In .NET4.5, the following feature will be added:
•	AlwaysOn support in SqlClient;
•	Support for the new spatial types in Denali;
•	Connection pool resiliency;
•	Support for NBCROW/Sparse Columns;
•	SQL Express Local Database Runtime support in SqlClient;
•	Async.NET support in SqlClient;
•	Password stored in memory as a SecureString;
•	Extended Protection for NTLM authentication in SqlClient;
•	SSL Certificate Validation in SqlClient;
•	Correlated Tracing ID support in SqlClient;
•	ARM Processor support in ADO.NET.
The purpose of this session is to describe these features.

## Speaker(s): Kevin Kline, Buck Woody
## Title: This Ain't Your Father's Cloud
## Description:
### We won't lie to you. Some of the technical professionals at PASS have been doing this a LONG time. They've seen trends come and go. (SOA, anyone? N-tier architectures? "i-" or "e-" everything?) At least one professional, Former PASS director Kevin Kline, has been around the block a time or two and has seen fads come and go. Buck Woody, Microsoft's Senior (in every sense of the word) Technical Specialist on Windows and SQL Azure doesn't think "Cloud" is a fad. In fact, he thinks he can prove to Kevin it isn't, and if you're not careful, you might learn something in the process.
This ain't your father's presentation, kids. OK, maybe it is, but it promises to be useful, funny and informational. Grab your prune-juice and stake out your Lazy-Boy lounger early. We have to get out of here in time for these guys to get back to the home before dark.

# Five Physical Database Design Blunders and How to Avoid Them
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 12-10-2011 10:15 - Category: Spotlight Session (90 minutes) - Track: Application and Database Development
## Speaker(s): Karen Lopez
## Title: Five Physical Database Design Blunders and How to Avoid Them
## Description:
### What’s going on in your physical data models and databases? Who actually decides what goes into the database design?  How do you choose your primary keys? How do you implement them? Are GUIDs bad, good or "it depends"? Are your datatypes the right ones for the data? How can you measure the cost, benefits and risks of any design recommendation?  Are there universally good design practices? Universally bad design practices? 

In this presentation we discuss five physical database design mistakes that cost you dearly: performance snags, development delays, bugs, and professional respect. Data professionals are often tasked to prepare physical data models, yet these skills usually overlap those of other team members and this overlap can lead to contention, confusion, and complacency. 

In this presentation, you’ll learn about the five blunders, how to find them as well as many tips on how to avoid them. You learn how to talk about and defend your design recommendations and how to ensure that you have the information to demonstrate they are the right designs for your project.

Bring your armor, snark and humor.  Blunders can be fun no matter how bad they are.

## Speaker(s): Paul Turley
## Title: Visual Report Design:  Bringing Sexy Back
## Description:
### Do your users have the same old, mundane table reports they’ve been using for decades?  Stop living in the past and make your reports pop.  Learn to use design patterns, best practices and visuals that pack more usable information into fewer, more usable reports.  Use Reporting Services and other Microsoft BI tools to create dynamic, browse-able reports that answer important business questions at a glance and then let them explore the details to gain business insight and take action.
Sure, Business Intelligence is all the rage but you don’t have to invest in an entire BI platform to have fresh, usable reports.  These design techniques apply to enterprise analytic solutions and smaller-scale operational reporting.

## Title: Evolution of Security: What's New in Denali
## Description:
### Microsoft rebuilt SQL Security from the ground up in SQL Server 2005, and since then they've evolved database security in each new version. Denali continues that trend with some interesting new features, such as new server-level role features, new hashing algorithms, and new permissions. It also adds contained databases, which let users connect to the database without authenticating at the server level. This is a great feature that solves problems when you move databases, but it sounds scary from a security perspective. During this session, we'll explore all of the new security features in Denali. At the end of the session you'll have everything you need to decide for yourself whether your databases will be adequately protected in Denali or if security is getting way too onerous in SQL Server, and whether these new features alone make Denali a compelling upgrade!

## Title: Inside Tempdb
## Description:
### Perhaps one of the most frustrating, least understood, and contentious areas (no pun intended) of the SQL Server Engine is tempdb.  In this half-day session, we will drive into the internals of the tempdb database. I will warn you up front. This is a 500 level session and will be a very deep internal discussion. It will be very fast-paced with much information to consume. As with past presentations I’ve done I will be using tools like the Windows Debugger, DMVs, DBCC commands, and possibly even hex editors. I will use as aid in presentation details of memory structures, classes, and bitmaps, Even with the depth of this presentation, I believe anyone will walk away with many practical pieces of knowledge and advice that can help you avoid problems and maximize your usage of tempdb.
 
This presentation will cover (but not limited to) the following topics:
 
•         Differences between tempdb and other databases
•         Internals of tempdb allocation
•         Internals of temporary objects (temp tables, table variables, worktables, ….)
•         Caching of temporary objects
•         Internals of tempdb logging
•         Tempdb latch and lock contention
•         Pushing the limits of tempdb
•         Monitoring usage and behavior of tempdb
•         Troubleshooting the common and advanced tempdb problems
 
While this presentation include slides and information about tempdb it will also be mixed with a rich set of demonstrations to see the behavior (or misbehavior) of tempdb with SQL Server applications.

## Speaker(s): Victor Isakov
## Title: The Ultimate Session on Indexing
## Description:
### You can have the best hardware possible: SSDs, TBs of RAM and 100s of processors. (Don't we all wish we had such budgets.) But if you don't have the correct indexing strategy in place your database can still perform poorly. With the next version of SQL Server there are even more options available. Confused about what indexing strategy to use? Then this is the session for you!
In this session Victor Isakov (MCA, MCM, MCT, MVP) will cover all of the indexing options that are available in SQL Server and when best to use them. Victor will cover "practical" internals that will help you understand how indexes work and why you need to maintain them. Finally he will cover what indexing strategies to use given the most important considerations: your users, their query patterns and your data.
This should prove to be a most informative and practical session that will enable you to optimize your database performance.

## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: DMOs as a Shortcut for Performance Tuning
## Description:
### Dynamic Management Objects(DMO) expose a wealth of information to the database administrator. However, they also expose information that is vital to the database developer. More often than not people gather performance metrics through server side traces, but they don't have to. This session will show how to gather information from the DMOs for currently executing, and recently executed queries. The session will demonstrate combining this information with other DMOs to get more interesting information such as the query plan and query text. I'll show where you can get aggregate information for the queries in cache to determine which queries are being frequently accessed or using the most resources. I'll show how to determine which indexes are being used in your system and which are not. All of this will be focused, not on the DBA, but on the query writer, the developer or database developer that needs information to tune and troubleshoot data access.

### This session will provide you with some surprising and interesting insights into how dashboards and reports should be designed. Called Information Visualization, there is a whole line of thinking which maps how the brain interprets what the eyes see. We will translate this into best (and worst) practices related to visualization in dashboard, scorecard, table, and report design. Both funny and informative, you will probably learn, as I did, that you have been designing your dashboards/scorecards and reports badly. We are going to take a visualization test, and learn how to convey information in a clearer, better way. You will be surprised. Join me - this session is going to be hoot!

## Speaker(s): Allen White
## Title: Let Service Broker Help You Scale Your Application
## Description:
### How your business applications interact with the corporate database directly can have a dramatic impact on how successful you are, and one of the biggest issues is performance with large databases.  By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates you can focus performance concerns to where the timeliness is critical.  SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently, and minimizes the conflicts with your critical updates.  This session will walk you through the steps to get Service Broker up and running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.

## Speaker(s): Alberto Ferrari
## Title: Many-to-Many Relationships in DAX
## Description:
### The introduction of many to many dimension relationships in SSAS (since 2005) opened new scenarios that can be solved using OLAP cubes. Now, with the introduction of the Vertipaq engine and the DAX programming language, it seems that many-to-many relationships are no longer supported. As we are going to show, this is not true: many-to-many relationships can be leveraged in DAX too, even if this means some deep understanding of the Vertipaq engine and of the DAX programming language. During the session we will show many scenarios where many-to-many relationships can be managed by using DAX. The implementations are different from those used in SSAS, both from the data modeling and from the programming points of view. Gaining the ability to master many-to-many relationships will open new modeling scenarios that look very promising in SSAS.

## Title: Why are we Waiting..
## Description:
### An in-depth session examining "Waits" happening in your SQL Servers, using the well-known "Waits & Queues" methodology.

With particular focus in the session on understanding and interpreting the information found the (DMV) sys.dm_os_wait_stats,
Taking note of which “Waits “with the highest counts or excessive wait times, as well as those which “Waits” can be safely ignored, 
We can discover those "performance hurdles" and ways to overcome or remove them, restoring your SQL Servers performance levels.
By using established methodologies like “Waits & Queues”, we can systematically identify and remove performance hurdles; to do this we must have a way to interpret this wait information, the session will incorporate demos based on real-world examples to illustrate how to find those "Waits" that cause the degrading of performance levels in your SQL Servers – can you afford not to know this information?

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Characteristics of a Great Relational Database 
## Description:
### When queried, most database professionals would mention normalized as one of the most important characteristics that tell the difference between a good and bad database design. I won't disagree in the least, but there is so much more to be considered.  Even if you did a great job of normalization, poor naming, poorly implemented keys, too many or too few indexes, and so on can derail your design.  In this session I will present seven primary characteristics of a design that differentiates between an ugly design that will have your colleagues nitpicking you to death and one that will have them singing your praises. Characteristics such as comprehendible, documented, secure, well performing, and more (including normalized, naturally) will be discussed.

## Speaker(s): Buck Woody
## Title: Beyond the Hype - Hybrid Solutions for On-Premise and In-Cloud Database Applications
## Description:
### Despite all the hype, it’s rare for a business to actually “move” an application directly to the cloud. The cost, risk and effort aren’t usually worth the benefit of what you gain. Security considerations, performance, and control are just a few of the reasons that many applications need to stay in your datacenter. But there are times when including a function from the cloud makes a ton of business sense, either to extend part of your internal applications to remote workers, customers or partners, or to act as a HA/DR solution.
 
In this session, Buck Woody (Microsoft Senior Technology Specialist on Distributed Computing) will talk about how you can embrace Cloud on Your Terms through SQL Server Code Name "Denali" and Windows and SQL Azure architectures, and the considerations for creating a hybrid architecture across on-premise databases and cloud technologies. You’ll learn:

# Important Trace Flags That Every DBA Should Know

## Speaker(s): Victor Isakov
## Title: Important Trace Flags That Every DBA Should Know
## Description:
### There are a number of important trace flags that should be implemented in most production environments. Yet many DBAs think that trace flags should only be used for testing purposes or to "show-off" at conferences. That they are not supported. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. A good example is trace flag 4199. (Yes, it's probably worth your while reading KB974006 to understand what trace flag 4199 does!). In this session, Victor Isakov (MCA, MCM, MCT, MVP) and Julie Koesmarno (MCITP) will present the important trace flags that all DBAs should know, what they do, when to implement them and how best to implement them in a production environment. This will enable you to maximize the performance and reliability of your SQL Server infrastructure.

## Speaker(s): Arie Jones
## Title: Everything Your Developer Won’t Tell You About SQL Azure 
## Description:
### Cloud computing is being hailed by some as the future silver bullet to everyone’s data availability woes and as such SQL Azure is Microsoft’s cloud based data platform. However, the platform is much different from simply a SQL Server that sits in the cloud and needs to be approached in an intelligent manner.  In this fast paced session, we will be going well beyond the simple “hello world” scenario to show you how to leverage the cloud architecture for data storage as well as educate you in how the cloud works differently than your local database instance. We’ll give you all of the powers and perils that exist in the architecture to ensure that your first flight into the cloud is a successful one. This session is going to be an eye opener for sure and will have many of you dreaming of your data sitting in the cloud.

## Speaker(s): Don Kiely
## Title: Code-First Development with the Entity Framework
## Description:
### Entity Framework 4 and before used a database-first style of development, wherein the database had to exist before you built the entity data model. But Microsoft has made available an update to EF 4 that supports code-first development, in which you create the model first using tools in Visual Studio 2010. With code-first development, you don't have to create entities in a designer or do any kind of XML mapping. Instead, you define model objects by writing regular .NET classes, including validation rules and a context class that handles retrieving and persisting data, and then create a database from your model. But how good is the resulting database? Are there any pitfalls to this style of development? Can a developer do real database development with code-first? During this session you'll learn about this powerful feature in Entity Framework and see how to put it to use, as well as explore the issues involved with its development.

## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: What Happened? Exploring the Plan Cache
## Description:
### What Happened? Exploring the Plan Cache

Being pro-active,and using one of the various tracing capabilities of SQL Server, is the best way 

to keep track of what is going on in your SQL Server and what might be causing performance 

problems. But does that mean if you haven't set up any tracing, there is nothing you can do to 

find out what problematic queries might be running? The answer is no.

In this session, we'll explore SQL Server's plan cache, from the way it is managed in memory, to 

the tools and techniques for discovering what plans are in cache, how long they've been there, how 

often they've been run, and whether they contain any suspected sub-optimal operators, such as 

table scans and hash joins.  Knowing what's happened is the first step in knowing what needs to be fixed.

# Joins, SARGability and the Evils of Residualiciousness
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 13-10-2011 15:00 - Category: Spotlight Session (90 minutes) - Track: Application and Database Development
## Speaker(s): Rob Farley
## Title: Joins, SARGability and the Evils of Residualiciousness
## Description:
### You wouldn't believe how often people just aren't using their indexes effectively, whether it be searching for data, or joining tables. Quite often, this comes down to predicates becoming residual. Yes, residuality is a problem, and once a predicate has become residualicious, you may as well be scanning instead of seeking.

There’s so much more to SARGability than people think, and people can often miss out on significant performance benefits by not appreciating this – particularly with new and improved query hints becoming available in SQL 2008 R2 SP1 and Denali. 

SARGable means Search ARGument Able and relates to the ability to search through an index for a value. Unfortunately many database professionals don’t really understand it – especially in regard to joins – leading to queries which don’t run as well as they should. 

In this talk, you'll learn how to tell whether a predicate is being used correctly, and to evaluate what's really going on in your Seek or Join. You'll even learn to use new features in SQL 2008 R2 SP1 and Denali to affect the residuality of your predicates. This is a talk involving lots of demos, showing plenty of queries and execution plans.

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Description:
### In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

## Speaker(s): Tim Ford
## Title: The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects
## Description:
### It's time to have fun... WITH SCIENCE!

Since 1869, the periodic table of elements has been the standard for organizing and presenting many metrics for the substances from which life is based on.  I embrace the table as a prime example on how to present information - a great deal of it - in a concise and deeply informative fashion.  Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances.  

In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered.  We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yield interesting insights into your servers.  We will also look at how things can go awry as well!  Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!

## Description:
### One of the pillars of SQL Server 2008 R2 is Managed Self-Service BI. The SQL Server PowerPivot for Excel add-in is a key offering in this pillar, and delivers an entirely new analytic experience to Excel 2010. The add-in allows analysts to load and prepare large volumes of data from various sources to create a multidimensional model. The model can be enriched with sophisticated calculations. Then the model can then be used as the source for PivotTable and PivotChart reports. And yet that’s not the end of the story. With the SQL Server PowerPivot for SharePoint add-in, the Excel workbooks that host the PowerPivot model can be catalogued in SharePoint and exposed as a data source for other Excel and Reporting Services reports. These SharePoint hosted models can then be managed by IT with scheduled data refreshes from the originating data stores.

In this session, you will be introduced to the two add-ins. An end-to-end series of theory, demonstrations and discussion will describe how you can effectively leverage the add-ins with your own data and analysis requirements.

## Speaker(s): Jason Strate
## Title: Discovering the Plan Cache
## Description:
### Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache.  This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning.  By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries.  This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes.  All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache.  In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

## Speaker(s): Maciej Pilecki
## Title: SQL Server Execution Plans – From Compilation To Caching To Reuse
## Description:
### Execution plan reuse is one of the most important aspects of building well-performing and scalable SQL Server solutions. But it's also the one that is often overlooked during the design phase and becomes very difficult to troubleshoot later. In this session we will discuss in details the following aspects of SQL Server execution plans: compilation, re-compilation, parameterization, caching, reuse and aging. You will leave this session with full understanding of how to improve your server's performance by increasing execution plan reuse (and how to avoid reuse in case this is necessary).

## Speaker(s): Joy Mundy
## Title: One Hard Problem: Multivalued Dimension Relationships
## Description:
### Many attendees know the basics of dimensional modeling: facts, dimensions, and dimension attribute change management. But we never seem to find time to talk about the hard problems. This session addresses a thorny dimensional design challenge in a holistic manner: How do we handle multivalued dimension relationships, where a fact row corresponds to potentially many rows in the dimension table?

The solution – as with most solutions in the DW/BI space – begins with the data model. But there are issues to be concerned about during ETL, SSAS, usability, and query performance as well. In this session we describe how to identify various types of multivalued dimension relationship problems; you'll learn about the standard design solutions, and the pluses and minuses of each approach. We'll show you some tricks (none perfect) for avoiding multivalued dimensions. You'll learn how to build the ETL to populate said dimensions, as well as the Analysis Services cube and associated calculations. Finally, learn what you'll to teach your users about the ad hoc use of the multivalued dimension.

Big Data – What is the Big Deal?

Are you ready for the exploding world of big data?  Do you know the difference between Hive and Pig?  Do you know why MapReduce is being taught in many universities rather than SQL?  If not, pay attention because this talk will help get you started in understanding this new world. While sometimes the Hadoop toolkit (which includes HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Pig, and Sqoop) is used as an alternative to relational database systems such as SQL Server, more frequently customers are using it as a complementary tool. Sometimes it may be used as an ETL tool or to perform an initial analysis of a freshly acquired data set to determine whether or not it is worth loading into the data warehouse, and sometimes to process massive data sets that are too big to even contemplate loading into all but the very largest data warehouses. In addition to covering the basics of the various parts of the Hadoop stack, this talk will discuss the strengths and weakness of the Hadoop approach compared to that provided by relational database systems and explores how the two technologies can be used productively in conjunction with one another.

## Speaker(s): Jen Stirrup
## Title: Data Visualization: Chaos, or Patterns you haven't recognized yet?
## Description:
### Data Visualisation is an essential tool for Business Intelligence specialists. It reveals patterns in the data, which businesses can use as intelligence to perform better. Edward de Bono once commented that “Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way” – but business users need to see the patterns in order to be creative problem solvers!
I will discuss the perceptual and cognitive processes involved in finding patterns in the data. I will use SQL Server Reporting Services 2008 R2 to demonstrate some of the less well-known data visualisations, such heatmaps, bullet charts, and other visualisations based on Tufte's "small multiples" such as Sparklines and Sploms.

## Speaker(s): Jerome Halmans, Rong Wu
## Title: Using Correlated Tracing to Diagnose Query Level Performance
## Description:
### Diagnosing production issues affecting Microsoft SQL Server can be difficult and time consuming. Determining whether the problem lies in the client or the server adds even more difficulty.  With SQL Server code name “Denali”, diagnostic capabilities have been enhanced with Extended Events and integration with Data Access Trace. These enhancements provide the capability to trace requests from clients to the lowest levels of SQL Server, find resource contention and determine what is really slowing down your queries.  

This talk will focus on using the diagnostic capabilities of Extended Events, which provides visibility into the internal operations of SQL Server and how these capabilities can be combined with client traces to pinpoint the source of production issues.

## Speaker(s): Adam Machanic
## Title: Query Tuning Mastery: Zen and the Art of Workspace Memory
## Description:
### As SQL Server professionals, we often think of memory in vague, instance-level terms: buffer pool, procedure cache, Virtual Address Space, and so on. But certain tasks require a more in-depth focus, and query tuning is one of them. Large, complex queries need memory in which to work--workspace memory--and understanding the how's, when's, and why's of this memory can help you create queries that run in seconds rather than minutes. This session will teach you how to guide the query processor to grant enough memory for top performance, while also keeping things balanced for the sake of concurrency. You will learn advanced monitoring techniques, expert-level application of specialized query hints, and the memory internals needed to put it all together. If you work with large queries and are serious about achieving scalability and consistently great performance, you owe it to yourself to attend this session.

## Speaker(s): Glenn Berry
## Title: Scaling SQL Server
## Description:
### How can you scale SQL Server? Scaling up is relatively easy (but can be expensive), while scaling out requires significant engineering time and effort. If you suggest hardware upgrades you may be accused of simply "throwing hardware at the problem", and if you try to scale out, you may be thwarted by a lack of development resources or 3rd party software restrictions. As your database server nears its load capacity, what can you do? This session gives you concrete, practical advice on how to deal with this situation. Starting with your present workload, configuration and hardware, we will explore how to find and alleviate bottlenecks, whether they are workload related, configuration related, or hardware related. Next, we will 
cover how you can decide whether you should scale up or scale out your data tier. Once that decision is made, you will learn how to scale up properly, with nearly zero down-time. If you decide to scale out, you will learn about practical, production-ready techniques such as vertical partitioning, horizontal partitioning, and data dependent routing.

## Title: Data Ownership, Data Stewardship and Data Governance
## Description:
### It's becoming all too common these days for data to just "exist", without know who's truly responsible for updating it, maintaining it and validating it. It's falling on the DB Professional to act as the owner, the steward and the governor of data. That won't work. Business areas need to retain ownership. The concep of "stewardship" seems to have died completely, and "governance" just falls under the umbrella of master data management.  This session attempts to split out what the business and technical roles are when it comes to data, and how to encourage your entire business organization to participate in the responsibility of data.

# Temporal Snapshot Fact Table

## Speaker(s): Davide Mauri
## Title: Temporal Snapshot Fact Table
## Description:
### You are designing a BI Solution and your customer ask you to keep a snapshot of the status of all their documents (orders, insurances, contracts, bills...whatever the word "document" may mean) for all the days  of the year. They have millions of documents and they want to have in their Data Warehouse all the data they have gathered right from the very first operating day.
If you have 1 million of documents (on average) and you have to keep a snapshot of them for each one of the 365 days in a year, and you have 10 year of history, you're going to have a 3 billions table just to start with. That's a very big and challenging number, and you may have not the option to buy a Parallel Data Warehouse. 
In this session, we'll see how we can turn the usual snapshot tables into temporal table so that we can store time intervals in order to avoid data duplication, while keeping the Data Warehouse design usable by Analysis Services (that doesn't know what an interval is) and optimizing it to have very good performance even on standard hardware.
The explained technique is a result of several month of research and has been applied to the Data Warehouse of an insurance company where we had to deal with two times the number said before.

## Title: Best Practices for Deploying SQL Server on VMware - "What every DBA needs to know to be successful for virtual deployments"
## Description:
### Many virtualization customers have begun looking at virtualizing their tier-1 applications, such as their ERP systems, SAP and SharePoint environments. At the heart of many of these business critical systems is Microsoft SQL. As virtualization has evolved applications once considered too heavy to move out of the physical world are now being reevaluated for virtualization. Microsoft SQL can now take advantage of many of the features that vSphere provides out of the box such as support for 64-bit technologies, NUMA support and hot-add CPU and memory. This session will cover design considerations for virtualizing SQL workloads, performance and scalability information, high-availability options, support considerations, as well as what’s new in ESX 5.

## Title: T-SQL Awesomeness - 3 Ways to Write Cool SQL
## Description:
### There’s nothing quite as satisfying as writing a cool bit of T-SQL.  Luckily for us, there are some truly awesome ways to make your data do just what you need it to do, all while improving performance and/or readability.  Come learn three new-school ways to expand your T-SQL repertoire with:  
•	Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTE)
•	EXCEPT and INTERSECT
•	CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY
We will look at data models and development scenarios you might encounter that lend themselves to these techniques, see old-school ways to solve T-SQL challenges, and then compare alternate, new-school ways to get the same result set.  Evaluating different approaches based on performance, readability, and maintainability, we’ll ask the important questions:  Is it faster?  Is it prettier?  Can I hand it off to the new guy to maintain?  
The goal of this session is simple:  Be able to impress your friends and confound your frenemies with your mad T-SQL skills.
