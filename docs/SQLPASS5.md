## Speaker(s): Adam Saxton
## Title: Winning with Kerberos
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 We will dive into how Kerberos works and what types of scenarios you will see in your environment when working with the SQL Stack.  This will include the SQL Engine, Reporting Services and Analysis Services along with PowerPivot/Excel Calc Services.  We will look at how different deployment topologies can affect your configuration and how to plan properly for those.  This includes Web Farms and SQL Clusters. I will be using tools such as Network Monitor, SetSPN along with some Active Directory tools to demonstrate how to configure and diagnose issue that may occur in your environment.
 
You will walk away with a checklist for what you need to do to configure Kerberos correctly as well as an understanding of what tools are available to you to help diagnose issues when you get into trouble. 
 
This session will include (but not limited to) the following areas:
 
•         Breaking down the Service Principal Name (SPN)
•         Constrained Delegation vs. Full Delegation
•         SQL Kerberos Configuration
•         Analysis Services Kerberos Configuration
•         Reporting Services Kerberos Configuration
•         Web Farm and Cluster Considerations
•         How PowerPivot using Excel Calc Services within SharePoint can affect you
•         A look at Claims Auth and how that affects Kerberos
 
So, bring your questions and your tiger blood, and we will delve into the complex topic that is Kerberos.

## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: Virtualization and SAN Basics for DBAs
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 These two technologies can make a very big – and very bad – difference in how your SQL Server performs. Wouldn’t it be great if you could get the real, honest lowdown from a virtualization administrator, a SAN administrator, and a DBA? Wouldn’t it be even better if one person had done all three, and could give you the pros and cons of each point of view? That person is Brent Ozar, a Microsoft Certified Master who’s been there and done that.

If you've seen (and liked) Brent's one-hour session on this topic, you'll like the pre-con.  He goes into more depth and detail, showing examples and live demos to prove points about memory, storage, and CPU.  You'll leave ready to challenge your SAN and VMware admins.

# Fixing Queries With Advanced T-SQL Constructs
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 10-10-2011 08:30 - Category: Pre-conference Session (7 hours) - Track: Application and Database Development
## Speaker(s): Rob Farley
## Title: Fixing Queries With Advanced T-SQL Constructs
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 Have you inherited queries that are not your own, and are finding that performance isn’t so great? Removing cursors in favor of set-based queries is useful, but even set-based queries can perform poorly. Understanding the impact that various constructs can have on a query plan could be key to resolving many of these issues.

In this seminar, irrepressible SQL MVP Rob Farley will take a look at some real-life queries and take the audience through examples of constructs that can have significant effects on tuning. This will include complex nested joins, join simplification, procedural functions, SARGability v residuality with predicates, better execution plan reading, start-up parameters, force hints, complex sorting, ORs, effective Dynamic SQL, GROUP BY v DISTINCT, unique indexes, temporary tables, APPLY considerations, and more. You'll discover profoundness in things you thought you knew, and you'll even see when a covering index that returns a single row can be a bad thing.

This will be a day spent in Management Studio, not PowerPoint. If you want to know how to persuade the Query Optimizer to do a better job of running your query, this day is for you. The examples will apply to a variety of versions, with most of it being useful even in a SQL 2005 environment.

# All about Execution Plans
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 10-10-2011 08:30 - Category: Pre-conference Session (7 hours) - Track: Application and Database Development
## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey, Gail Shaw
## Title: All about Execution Plans
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required

. 

The key to understanding how SQL Server is processing your queries is the execution plan. 



This full day session focuses on the execution plan. We will start right at the beginning and talk about the compile process. We’ll also go over how, and more importantly, why, plans are stored in cache and how they are removed. 



We’ll spend time exploring the key differences between actual and estimated plans, and why those descriptions are more than a little misleading. We’ll also show you assorted methods to obtain a query's execution plan and what the differences and tradeoffs of each are.



A full day class on execution plans would not be complete without spending time learning to reading them. You’ll learn where to find useful information in execution plans, what the common operators are and how to decipher the sometimes cryptic messages the plans are sending to you. We'll also debunk some myths surrounding query operators and execution plans.



All of this is meant to further your understanding of how queries work in order to improve the queries you’re responsible for. With this in mind, we’ll show how you can use execution plans to tune queries. All of the information presented will be taken from real world examples. We’ll build on the information through the day so that at the end, after following us through multiple examples at your own computer, you’ll have a stronger understanding of how to read, interpret and actually use execution plans in your day-to-day job.

## Title:  MDX, DAX, and DMX: An Introduction to the Languages of BI 
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 To get the most of the presentation layer tools in the Microsoft BI stack when data sources include cubes, PowerPivot workbooks, and data mining models, you can't rely solely on your T-SQL skills. To produce high-performing reports and analytical tools, you'll need to use other query languages like MDX, DAX, or DMX. In this workshop, you'll learn which languages each presentation layer tool supports and the basic syntax used by each language. You'll also learn how take advantage of query builder tools to help you produce queries until you've developed the proficiency to create more complex queries on your own. In addition, you'll learn how to work with expressions to add calculations to cubes and PowerPivot workbooks, and how to use expressions to customize the appearance of reports, scorecards, and dashboards.

## Speaker(s): Jonathan Kehayias
## Title: Extended Events Deep Dive
## Description:
### Pre-con Registration is Required.
 At PASS 2010 after the public release of CTP1 of SQL Server Denali, the product team demonstrated a replacement for SQL Profiler built on top of Extended Events.  The writing is on the wall for SQL Trace and the future of diagnostic profiling in SQL Server is Extended Events. In this workshop you will learn Extended Events from the ground up; from the original implementation in SQL Server 2008 to the enhancements that have been made in SQL Server Denali that redefine data collection for troubleshooting in SQL Server. 


Extended Events provide more information about the operations of SQL Server than have ever before been available in the product.  Unfortunately, there is a significant learning gap between Extended Events and SQL Trace; and the lack of a UI has only made the learning curve that much steeper.  This full-day deep dive workshop will explain the basic concepts of extended events, spin that information into some basic patterns, and build on those patterns to create complex custom functionality that will prepare you for the future.  Learn firsthand from the developer of the SSMS Addin for Extended Events in SQL Server 2008 how to leverage Extended Events in your own environment.

# Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 12-10-2011 10:15 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration and Deployment
## Speaker(s): Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer
## Description:
### The SQL Server Query Optimizer is a cost-based optimizer: it analyzes a number of candidate execution plans for a given query, estimates the cost of each of these plans, and selects the plan with the lowest cost. In this session I will go into the internals of the Query Optimizer and will show you the steps that it performs in the background covering everything from the time a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated. I’ll show you how the Query Optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, how these plans are stored for the duration of the optimization process, how heuristics are used to limit the number of alternative plans considered, how each candidate plan is also costed, and finally how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs. I will also cover why query optimization is an inherently complex problem and why challenges in some of its most fundamental areas are still being addressed today.

## Speaker(s): Paul Turley
## Title: Visual Report Design:  Bringing Sexy Back
## Description:
### Do your users have the same old, mundane table reports they’ve been using for decades?  Stop living in the past and make your reports pop.  Learn to use design patterns, best practices and visuals that pack more usable information into fewer, more usable reports.  Use Reporting Services and other Microsoft BI tools to create dynamic, browse-able reports that answer important business questions at a glance and then let them explore the details to gain business insight and take action.
Sure, Business Intelligence is all the rage but you don’t have to invest in an entire BI platform to have fresh, usable reports.  These design techniques apply to enterprise analytic solutions and smaller-scale operational reporting.

## Speaker(s): Victor Isakov
## Title: The Ultimate Session on Indexing
## Description:
### You can have the best hardware possible: SSDs, TBs of RAM and 100s of processors. (Don't we all wish we had such budgets.) But if you don't have the correct indexing strategy in place your database can still perform poorly. With the next version of SQL Server there are even more options available. Confused about what indexing strategy to use? Then this is the session for you!
In this session Victor Isakov (MCA, MCM, MCT, MVP) will cover all of the indexing options that are available in SQL Server and when best to use them. Victor will cover "practical" internals that will help you understand how indexes work and why you need to maintain them. Finally he will cover what indexing strategies to use given the most important considerations: your users, their query patterns and your data.
This should prove to be a most informative and practical session that will enable you to optimize your database performance.

## Speaker(s): Tim Mitchell
## Title: Advanced Components in SSIS
## Description:
### Spend a couple of hours creating data flows in SSIS and you'll quickly figure out how things work - initialize a connection, connect to a source, and write to a destination.  Add a few components such as lookups, conditional splits, and derived column transformations, and you've covered the most common functions of data movement in SSIS.  Move beyond the basics, though, and you'll find a treasure chest of components that are used much less often, but are no less valuable for some of the off-the-beaten-path ETL needs you'll eventually encounter.  In this session, we'll examine some of these less frequently used tools.  We'll briefly tour and then demonstrate SSIS components such as the fuzzy lookup, fuzzy grouping, term extraction, term lookup, and the script component.

## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: DMOs as a Shortcut for Performance Tuning
## Description:
### Dynamic Management Objects(DMO) expose a wealth of information to the database administrator. However, they also expose information that is vital to the database developer. More often than not people gather performance metrics through server side traces, but they don't have to. This session will show how to gather information from the DMOs for currently executing, and recently executed queries. The session will demonstrate combining this information with other DMOs to get more interesting information such as the query plan and query text. I'll show where you can get aggregate information for the queries in cache to determine which queries are being frequently accessed or using the most resources. I'll show how to determine which indexes are being used in your system and which are not. All of this will be focused, not on the DBA, but on the query writer, the developer or database developer that needs information to tune and troubleshoot data access.

## Speaker(s): Jen Stirrup
## Title: Intelligent Laziness with the Management Data Warehouse – why work harder, when you can work smarter?
## Description:
### In this session, we are going to look at ways to help DBAs work smarter rather than harder when troubleshooting SQL Server performance problems! We will look at the Management Data Warehouse (MDW), which is a SQL Server database which holds data about the performance of SQL Server databases. Specifically, the MDW stores the standard performance counters which help performance monitoring and troubleshooting, thereby helping DBAs to commence a detailed analysis of the performance more quickly – leading to quicker performance troubleshooting and resolution. This session will cover:

- The extraction of data from the MDW
- The standard reports available
- How to create customized reports using SSRS 2008 R2 using the MDW using best principles of data visualization (Stephen Few, Edward Tufte, to name a few).

Join this session to help you to proactively manage your performance monitoring using the MDW whilst using intelligent laziness to get quicker answers to your performance monitoring issues.

## Speaker(s): Alberto Ferrari
## Title: Many-to-Many Relationships in DAX
## Description:
### The introduction of many to many dimension relationships in SSAS (since 2005) opened new scenarios that can be solved using OLAP cubes. Now, with the introduction of the Vertipaq engine and the DAX programming language, it seems that many-to-many relationships are no longer supported. As we are going to show, this is not true: many-to-many relationships can be leveraged in DAX too, even if this means some deep understanding of the Vertipaq engine and of the DAX programming language. During the session we will show many scenarios where many-to-many relationships can be managed by using DAX. The implementations are different from those used in SSAS, both from the data modeling and from the programming points of view. Gaining the ability to master many-to-many relationships will open new modeling scenarios that look very promising in SSAS.

### An in-depth session examining "Waits" happening in your SQL Servers, using the well-known "Waits & Queues" methodology.

With particular focus in the session on understanding and interpreting the information found the (DMV) sys.dm_os_wait_stats,
Taking note of which “Waits “with the highest counts or excessive wait times, as well as those which “Waits” can be safely ignored, 
We can discover those "performance hurdles" and ways to overcome or remove them, restoring your SQL Servers performance levels.
By using established methodologies like “Waits & Queues”, we can systematically identify and remove performance hurdles; to do this we must have a way to interpret this wait information, the session will incorporate demos based on real-world examples to illustrate how to find those "Waits" that cause the degrading of performance levels in your SQL Servers – can you afford not to know this information?

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Characteristics of a Great Relational Database 
## Description:
### When queried, most database professionals would mention normalized as one of the most important characteristics that tell the difference between a good and bad database design. I won't disagree in the least, but there is so much more to be considered.  Even if you did a great job of normalization, poor naming, poorly implemented keys, too many or too few indexes, and so on can derail your design.  In this session I will present seven primary characteristics of a design that differentiates between an ugly design that will have your colleagues nitpicking you to death and one that will have them singing your praises. Characteristics such as comprehendible, documented, secure, well performing, and more (including normalized, naturally) will be discussed.

## Speaker(s): Victor Isakov
## Title: Important Trace Flags That Every DBA Should Know
## Description:
### There are a number of important trace flags that should be implemented in most production environments. Yet many DBAs think that trace flags should only be used for testing purposes or to "show-off" at conferences. That they are not supported. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. A good example is trace flag 4199. (Yes, it's probably worth your while reading KB974006 to understand what trace flag 4199 does!). In this session, Victor Isakov (MCA, MCM, MCT, MVP) and Julie Koesmarno (MCITP) will present the important trace flags that all DBAs should know, what they do, when to implement them and how best to implement them in a production environment. This will enable you to maximize the performance and reliability of your SQL Server infrastructure.

## Title: Everything Your Developer Won’t Tell You About SQL Azure 
## Description:
### Cloud computing is being hailed by some as the future silver bullet to everyone’s data availability woes and as such SQL Azure is Microsoft’s cloud based data platform. However, the platform is much different from simply a SQL Server that sits in the cloud and needs to be approached in an intelligent manner.  In this fast paced session, we will be going well beyond the simple “hello world” scenario to show you how to leverage the cloud architecture for data storage as well as educate you in how the cloud works differently than your local database instance. We’ll give you all of the powers and perils that exist in the architecture to ensure that your first flight into the cloud is a successful one. This session is going to be an eye opener for sure and will have many of you dreaming of your data sitting in the cloud.

## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: What Happened? Exploring the Plan Cache
## Description:
### What Happened? Exploring the Plan Cache

Being pro-active,and using one of the various tracing capabilities of SQL Server, is the best way 

to keep track of what is going on in your SQL Server and what might be causing performance 

problems. But does that mean if you haven't set up any tracing, there is nothing you can do to 

find out what problematic queries might be running? The answer is no.

In this session, we'll explore SQL Server's plan cache, from the way it is managed in memory, to 

the tools and techniques for discovering what plans are in cache, how long they've been there, how 

often they've been run, and whether they contain any suspected sub-optimal operators, such as 

table scans and hash joins.  Knowing what's happened is the first step in knowing what needs to be fixed.

# Joins, SARGability and the Evils of Residualiciousness
#### [Back to calendar](#id-5)
Event Date: 13-10-2011 15:00 - Category: Spotlight Session (90 minutes) - Track: Application and Database Development
## Speaker(s): Rob Farley
## Title: Joins, SARGability and the Evils of Residualiciousness
## Description:
### You wouldn't believe how often people just aren't using their indexes effectively, whether it be searching for data, or joining tables. Quite often, this comes down to predicates becoming residual. Yes, residuality is a problem, and once a predicate has become residualicious, you may as well be scanning instead of seeking.

There’s so much more to SARGability than people think, and people can often miss out on significant performance benefits by not appreciating this – particularly with new and improved query hints becoming available in SQL 2008 R2 SP1 and Denali. 

SARGable means Search ARGument Able and relates to the ability to search through an index for a value. Unfortunately many database professionals don’t really understand it – especially in regard to joins – leading to queries which don’t run as well as they should. 

In this talk, you'll learn how to tell whether a predicate is being used correctly, and to evaluate what's really going on in your Seek or Join. You'll even learn to use new features in SQL 2008 R2 SP1 and Denali to affect the residuality of your predicates. This is a talk involving lots of demos, showing plenty of queries and execution plans.

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Database Design Fundamentals
## Description:
### In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

## Speaker(s): Tim Ford
## Title: The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects
## Description:
### It's time to have fun... WITH SCIENCE!

Since 1869, the periodic table of elements has been the standard for organizing and presenting many metrics for the substances from which life is based on.  I embrace the table as a prime example on how to present information - a great deal of it - in a concise and deeply informative fashion.  Taking the periodic table of elements into consideration I've created The Periodic Table of Dynamic Management Objects as a reference tool for these functions and views that have become so critical for today's SQL Server DBA to performance tune and gain metadata insights into their various SQL instances.  

In navigating the table we will examine key DMVs and DMFs of interest: requests, sessions, wait stats, indexes, system information will all be covered.  We will also delve into how these DMOs - just like their elemental counterparts - can be combined to yield interesting insights into your servers.  We will also look at how things can go awry as well!  Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, sometimes combining DMOs can cause a big mess too!

We will discuss clustered indexes as well as non-clustered indexes and also when to use indexed views along with some other variations.

## Speaker(s): Jason Strate
## Title: Discovering the Plan Cache
## Description:
### Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache.  This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning.  By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries.  This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes.  All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache.  In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

Big Data – What is the Big Deal?

Are you ready for the exploding world of big data?  Do you know the difference between Hive and Pig?  Do you know why MapReduce is being taught in many universities rather than SQL?  If not, pay attention because this talk will help get you started in understanding this new world. While sometimes the Hadoop toolkit (which includes HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Pig, and Sqoop) is used as an alternative to relational database systems such as SQL Server, more frequently customers are using it as a complementary tool. Sometimes it may be used as an ETL tool or to perform an initial analysis of a freshly acquired data set to determine whether or not it is worth loading into the data warehouse, and sometimes to process massive data sets that are too big to even contemplate loading into all but the very largest data warehouses. In addition to covering the basics of the various parts of the Hadoop stack, this talk will discuss the strengths and weakness of the Hadoop approach compared to that provided by relational database systems and explores how the two technologies can be used productively in conjunction with one another.

## Speaker(s): Jerome Halmans, Rong Wu
## Title: Using Correlated Tracing to Diagnose Query Level Performance
## Description:
### Diagnosing production issues affecting Microsoft SQL Server can be difficult and time consuming. Determining whether the problem lies in the client or the server adds even more difficulty.  With SQL Server code name “Denali”, diagnostic capabilities have been enhanced with Extended Events and integration with Data Access Trace. These enhancements provide the capability to trace requests from clients to the lowest levels of SQL Server, find resource contention and determine what is really slowing down your queries.  

This talk will focus on using the diagnostic capabilities of Extended Events, which provides visibility into the internal operations of SQL Server and how these capabilities can be combined with client traces to pinpoint the source of production issues.

## Speaker(s): Glenn Berry
## Title: Scaling SQL Server
## Description:
### How can you scale SQL Server? Scaling up is relatively easy (but can be expensive), while scaling out requires significant engineering time and effort. If you suggest hardware upgrades you may be accused of simply "throwing hardware at the problem", and if you try to scale out, you may be thwarted by a lack of development resources or 3rd party software restrictions. As your database server nears its load capacity, what can you do? This session gives you concrete, practical advice on how to deal with this situation. Starting with your present workload, configuration and hardware, we will explore how to find and alleviate bottlenecks, whether they are workload related, configuration related, or hardware related. Next, we will 
cover how you can decide whether you should scale up or scale out your data tier. Once that decision is made, you will learn how to scale up properly, with nearly zero down-time. If you decide to scale out, you will learn about practical, production-ready techniques such as vertical partitioning, horizontal partitioning, and data dependent routing. We will also cover how to use middle-tier caching and other application techniques to increase your overall scalability.

## Title: Preventing the Oh, Poop! Reporting Situation
## Description:
### Have you ever received that dreaded call from the CEO?  The one where they ask what happened to their morning reports?  If so, you've been in an "Oh, Poop!" situation.  Using the Report Manager, Reporting Services provides a series of ways to track, log, and alert you in the event that something goes wrong.  You also have the ability to discover important report execution information by using the underlying database and data.  Learn the series of steps you should take to prevent being in that type of situation again.

## Speaker(s): James Luetkehoelter
## Title: Data Ownership, Data Stewardship and Data Governance
## Description:
### It's becoming all too common these days for data to just "exist", without know who's truly responsible for updating it, maintaining it and validating it. It's falling on the DB Professional to act as the owner, the steward and the governor of data. That won't work. Business areas need to retain ownership. The concep of "stewardship" seems to have died completely, and "governance" just falls under the umbrella of master data management.  This session attempts to split out what the business and technical roles are when it comes to data, and how to encourage your entire business organization to participate in the responsibility of data.

## Speaker(s): Benjamin Nevarez
## Title: Parameter Sniffing: the Query Optimizer vs. the Plan Cache
## Description:
### Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.

## Description:
### Have you ever gotten tired of your 1TB database taking 4+ hrs to backup?  Are you sick of having your users breathe down your neck for 2hrs because it’s taking too long to restore a DB?  Well now you don’t have to worry about that anymore.  I’m going to show you some little known tricks, methods, and trace flags you can use to tune your backups just like you would a query.  Backups actually have kind of an execution plan that you can access if you know how, and knowing how to get the individual portions of your backup process down will allow you to knock 80% and even more off of your backup and restore time.  I’m not holding anything back in this session.  This is a method I’ve used for 15yrs to tune my backups and I’ve had great success with it.
