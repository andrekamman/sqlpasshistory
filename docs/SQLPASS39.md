## Title: Build Your Own Monitoring System with PowerShell
## Description:
### Love to run Brent's sp_Blitz and use Ola's MaintenanceSolution, but you have dozens or even hundreds of servers?

Let's build a Powershell script together that will use Remoting to run whatever script you like in parallel on any number of servers. We'll talk about remoting, remoting across domains or even without, how to run scripts in the background and in parallel. I'll show you how to store the results and report on it across all your servers in one go.

This session will be presented based on an existing solution and will have lots of notes from the field. The focus will be mainly on configuring, debugging and using remoting and parallel processing but I will also show how to set up the plumbing around it to create a complete system.

## Title: Deep-Dive to Analysis Services Security
## Description:
### The Session will cover all advanced topics that you need to know about when developing high complex security solutions for your SSAS database. Those topics include cross-level dimension security, multiple role combinations and foremost dynamic security setups. All of them are designed for different business requirements but no solution fits them all. The different approaches will be examined on their impact on caching, connection time and also maintenance and in the end you probably understand why it can sometimes make sense to have 2000+ dynamic roles in your SSAS cube! A major part of the session will be dedicated to dynamic security using SSAS assemblies. Especially for complex requirements this is often the last hope.

## Title: Query Progress Tracking in SQL Server
## Description:
### It's 6PM on Thursday. You execute a process that usually takes a few minutes and start packing in order to start the weekend. You are already with your bag on your back, but the process doesn't finish. You start cursing yourself for not waiting to Monday, take off your bag and start searching for the problem. What should you do now? 
In this hands-on session, we will go over the ways SQL Server gives us for tracking progress of processes and queries, and identifying bottlenecks in real-time. 
Among other topics, we will talk about the percent_complete column, how the CXPacket wait type can help us, to Rollback or not to Rollback, and how the new sys.dm_exec_query_profiles DMV can help us.

## Speaker(s): Jen Stirrup
## Title: Pulling Back the Green Curtain: Data Forensics, Power BI, and Dataviz
## Description:
### In the Wizard of Oz, Toto pulls back the green curtain to expose that the Wizard of Oz is a fraud. In this session, we will look behind the 'green curtain' of the data visualisation to learn how to 'poke holes' in the data that you are given, both in business and in everyday news headlines. In order to explode the myths in the data that surrounds us every day, it is a little known secret that there are hidden patterns in the data chaos that surrounds us. Deviations from these patterns highlight invention, bias, anomalies and even deliberate fraud. Join Jen Stirrup to learn how to use both data visualisation in Power BI combined with timeless data analysis and patterns such as Benford's Law to reveal or conceal efforts to distort the numbers, and question the veracity of the data. You'll need courage, heart and wisdom to analyse data, since truthful data doesn't necessarily give easy answers!

## Speaker(s): Simon Lyngby Kokkendorff, Thorbjørn Nielsen
## Title: Denmark in Minecraft – a geosocial experiment
## Description:
### The Danish Geodata Agency (Geodatastyrelsen) ensures that geographical information about land and sea is collected, quality checked and made accessible on the internet. 

January 1 2013 marked a paradigm shift when a vast array of public sector information was made publicly available at no cost for private companies and citizens. To demonstrate an alternative use of the free public data, and to spur the interest for geographic data in education, the Geodata Agency launched the project “Denmark’s Free Geodata in a Minecraft World” in April 2014. The project comprises a nationwide set of Minecraft files available for download and an online demonstration hosted on three servers.  

In this talk we will present some of the technical challenges in creating the Minecraft model of Denmark, the data we used and the overwhelmingly positive response the initiative has received.

# A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#id-39)
Event Date: 02-03-2015 00:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development and Administration
## Speaker(s): Reeves Smith
## Title: A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS
## Description:
### Testing is a critical part of the release process and vital to a high-quality data management lifecycle. Unfortunately, Integration Services (SSIS) does not have built-in support for testing and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered. 
In this session, a new approach to unit testing (focusing on verifying the correctness of individual packages, tasks, or dataflows) and integration testing (focusing on validating that the data produced by an entire sequence of transformations) will be discussed. This development pattern uses metadata authored by analysts to automatically generate testing logic within the corresponding packages or to automatically generate standalone test packages that contain all of the necessary validation logic.

## Title: Superhero Power BI
## Description:
### Personal, heroic deeds, and the right gadgets are the making of a true superhero. In this day-long pre-conference session, learn how Power BI can enable the superhero in you to thwart evil deeds - aka "no data", "old data," and the all-too-common "incomplete data."

The aim of this session is to excite you with the potential of Microsoft's new self-service suite of BI products and collaboration platform, called Power BI. You will learn about four “Power” authoring products available in Excel and how they function to discover, acquire, transform, relate, and enrich data for analysis and reporting. Topics include Power Query, PowerPivot, Power View, and Power Map.

You will also learn how to effectively share and collaborate on Power BI solutions in the cloud with Office 365. Topics include data refresh to on-premise data, the data catalog to search for data queries, natural language query (Q&A) to intuitively query data, and a mobile application for Power BI.

This session has been designed to provide perspective across the Power BI story. Theory and an end-to-end series of real-world demonstrations will allow you to appreciate how the Power BI products span on-premise and cloud environments and how they attain super-strength as they work together.

## Title: Big Data Analytics with Excel
## Description:
### This session introduces the rationale for big data, and describes the problems big data platforms have been specifically designed to solve. It will demonstrate how to create a big data analytics solution with structured data by using Azure HDInsight, and then access and query it with Excel.

This session will be of interest to those new to the concept of big data, and who are interested to see a series of demonstrations that setup a big data cluster, prepare data, and use Pig and Hive to process and retrieve big data results. With a specific focus on self-service querying with Excel, big data results will be retrieved with Power Query, and queried by using Hive to process a Power Pivot data model.

## Speaker(s): Guy Glantser
## Title: How to Use Parameters Like a Pro and Boost Performance
## Description:
### Parameters are a fundamental part of T-SQL programming, whether they are used in stored procedures, in dynamic statements or in ad-hoc queries. Although widely used, most people aren't aware of the crucial influence they have on query performance. In fact, wrong use of parameters is one of the common reasons for poor application performance.
In this session we will learn about plan caching and how the query optimizer handles parameters. We will talk about the pros and cons of parameter sniffing as well as about simple vs. forced parameterization. But most important – we will learn how to identify performance problems caused by poor parameter handling, and we will also learn many techniques for solving these problems and boosting your application performance.

## Title: Power BI Dashboarding 
## Description:
### Power BI offers new features for creating dashboards on the cloud. In this session, you will learn how to create data models, display visualizations and synchronize cloud data with on premise data sources. In order to use these new features, you will continue to leverage existing skillsets, such as Tabular, Power Pivot, DAX, and you will be able to connect to database and semantic models you already built, such as existing databases in Analysis Services Multidimensional and Tabular. The goal is to create dashboards leveraging data and models that you already have both on cloud and on premise.

## Title: Data-Tier Considerations of Cloud-Based Application Design
## Description:
### Building modern applications for elastic scale, varying performance needs, and multi-tenancy can be achieved by breaking away from the traditional on-premises design point. In this session, we’ll discuss how you can blend a variety of Azure data services to best achieve performance, scale, cost-efficiencies, and data protection based on the needs of your cloud-born application data. The cloud opens up a new world of opportunity and innovation when it comes to database and application design and this demo-heavy session will provide a clear picture into leveraging these data services.

## Speaker(s): Kevin Boles
## Title: SQL Server Unit Testing
## Description:
### In the nearly 20 years I have been working with SQL Server, most of that as an independent consultant, I can count on two hands the number of clients I have come across that had ANY database tests constructed.  I can count on TWO FINGERS the number of them that had repeatable database tests.  Even the most ardent Agile/Scrum/pick-your-new-and-shiny-development-mantra shops hardly ever do anything more than wave a magic wand at testing the database, because it can be REALLY HARD to do and do correctly.  In this session we will cover examples of why repeatable database testing is CRITICALLY important and then examine a free framework that makes it both viable and straight-forward to create meaningful, repeatable SQL Server Unit Tests!

## Title: SQL Security in the Cloud
## Description:
### Our data should be secure. And our environment too. What we can do for maximize security in a hybrid environment, where SQL Server exist in two forms: premise and cloud. How organize our job, how control our data if we use Windows Azure SQL Database - The CLoud Database. Physical security, policy based management, auditing, encryption, federation, access and authorization. All of those subjects will be covered on my session.

## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Now Where Does THAT Estimate Come From?
## Description:
### The SQL Server Query Optimizer makes its plan choices based on estimated rowcounts. If those estimates are wrong, the optimizer will very likely produce a poor plan. And there's nothing you can do about it. Or is there?
In this session, you will learn exactly where these estimates come from. You will gain intimate knowledge of how statistics are used to estimate row counts, and how filters and joins further influence those estimates.
Though the focus of this session is on understanding the cause of bad estimates, you will also learn some ways to fix the problems and get better estimates - and hence, better performing queries.
