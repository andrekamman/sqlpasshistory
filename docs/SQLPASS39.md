## Speaker(s): André Kamman
## Title: Build Your Own Monitoring System with PowerShell
## Description:
### Love to run Brent's sp_Blitz and use Ola's MaintenanceSolution, but you have dozens or even hundreds of servers?

Let's build a Powershell script together that will use Remoting to run whatever script you like in parallel on any number of servers. We'll talk about remoting, remoting across domains or even without, how to run scripts in the background and in parallel. I'll show you how to store the results and report on it across all your servers in one go.

This session will be presented based on an existing solution and will have lots of notes from the field. The focus will be mainly on configuring, debugging and using remoting and parallel processing but I will also show how to set up the plumbing around it to create a complete system.

## Speaker(s): Tim Peterson
## Title: Use the Power of Analytical Hierarchies in Your Cubes
## Description:
### Analytical hierarchies bring the questions of the business analyst into the structure of the cubes. This session examines the power of analytical hierarchies, looking specifically at the opportunities provided by calculation hierarchies.

Calculation hierarchies give you the ability to build business models into your cubes. As the insights of business analysts are built into cube calculations, higher levels of insights can be achieved.

Analytical hierarchies can model forecasts and scenarios. They organize multidimensional data into meaningful patterns. Some of the most popular analytical hierarchies provide insight along the time dimension:

Current Period Calculations
Relative Date Period Calculations
Period To Date and Rolling Average Calculations
Comparison, Ratio, and Forecasting Calculations

This session demonstrates all of these types of analytical hierarchies and shows you how you can design and create the specific analytical hierarchies that you need for your organization.

## Speaker(s): Margarita Naumova
## Title: A Deep Dive into SQL Server Plan Cache Management
## Description:
### As an experienced DBA you have probably asked yourself questions like how the memory is consumed, is my system well-tuned, and is my memory configuration well defined. In order to understanding such processes as local and global Memory pressure, caches concurrency, adding and removing plans from cache we will go through the internal organization of the plan cache, the metadata available, how SQL Server finds a plan in cache, plan cache sizing, and the plan eviction policy. We will point out the important cache consumers that affect your workload and how to get metadata about them, what are the thresholds in Cache Size Management. At the end you will understand how to monitor the memory consumers in your SQL Server, what are wait types that we need to look at, how to understand if our system is well-tuned and the memory configuration is well defined.

# Deep-Dive to Analysis Services Security
#### [Back to calendar](#id-39)
Event Date: 02-03-2015 00:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development and Administration
## Speaker(s): Gerhard Brueckl
## Title: Deep-Dive to Analysis Services Security
## Description:
### The Session will cover all advanced topics that you need to know about when developing high complex security solutions for your SSAS database. Those topics include cross-level dimension security, multiple role combinations and foremost dynamic security setups. All of them are designed for different business requirements but no solution fits them all. The different approaches will be examined on their impact on caching, connection time and also maintenance and in the end you probably understand why it can sometimes make sense to have 2000+ dynamic roles in your SSAS cube! A major part of the session will be dedicated to dynamic security using SSAS assemblies. Especially for complex requirements this is often the last hope. This session will guide you through the most common and uncommon pitfalls that you will encounter and show how to work around them.

## Speaker(s): Matan Yungman
## Title: Query Progress Tracking in SQL Server
## Description:
### It's 6PM on Thursday. You execute a process that usually takes a few minutes and start packing in order to start the weekend. You are already with your bag on your back, but the process doesn't finish. You start cursing yourself for not waiting to Monday, take off your bag and start searching for the problem. What should you do now? 
In this hands-on session, we will go over the ways SQL Server gives us for tracking progress of processes and queries, and identifying bottlenecks in real-time. 
Among other topics, we will talk about the percent_complete column, how the CXPacket wait type can help us, to Rollback or not to Rollback, and how the new sys.dm_exec_query_profiles DMV can help us.

## Speaker(s): Jen Stirrup
## Title: Pulling Back the Green Curtain: Data Forensics, Power BI, and Dataviz
## Description:
### In the Wizard of Oz, Toto pulls back the green curtain to expose that the Wizard of Oz is a fraud. In this session, we will look behind the 'green curtain' of the data visualisation to learn how to 'poke holes' in the data that you are given, both in business and in everyday news headlines. In order to explode the myths in the data that surrounds us every day, it is a little known secret that there are hidden patterns in the data chaos that surrounds us. Deviations from these patterns highlight invention, bias, anomalies and even deliberate fraud. Join Jen Stirrup to learn how to use both data visualisation in Power BI combined with timeless data analysis and patterns such as Benford's Law to reveal or conceal efforts to distort the numbers, and question the veracity of the data. You'll need courage, heart and wisdom to analyse data, since truthful data doesn't necessarily give easy answers!

## Speaker(s): Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: SQL Server DR in Microsoft Azure—Building your Second Data Centre
## Description:
### SQL Server DR in Microsoft Azure—Building Your Second Data Center For many organizations, having a second data center or co-location is not a viable option, either from a financial or logistical perspective.

Traditionally, this would limit available options for disaster recovery (DR). However, now with Windows Azure virtual machines and SQL Server, you can design and build a highly available hybrid solution.

This session will showcase how you can use all of SQL Server’s DR features in this model, as well as how to build an environment solely in Windows Azure. You will learn to back up your databases to Azure Blob storage to protect backups. You will gain an understanding of the networking model within Azure. You will see the implementation of log shipping, replication, mirroring, and AlwaysOn Availability Groups in a hybrid model.

You will walk away with a solid understanding of AlwaysOn functionality within Windows Azure VMs, the costs and benefits of building a DR solution within

## Speaker(s): Simon Lyngby Kokkendorff, Thorbjørn Nielsen
## Title: Denmark in Minecraft – a geosocial experiment
## Description:
### The Danish Geodata Agency (Geodatastyrelsen) ensures that geographical information about land and sea is collected, quality checked and made accessible on the internet. 

January 1 2013 marked a paradigm shift when a vast array of public sector information was made publicly available at no cost for private companies and citizens. To demonstrate an alternative use of the free public data, and to spur the interest for geographic data in education, the Geodata Agency launched the project “Denmark’s Free Geodata in a Minecraft World” in April 2014. The project comprises a nationwide set of Minecraft files available for download and an online demonstration hosted on three servers.  

In this talk we will present some of the technical challenges in creating the Minecraft model of Denmark, the data we used and the overwhelmingly positive response the initiative has received.

# A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS
#### [Back to calendar](#id-39)
Event Date: 02-03-2015 00:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development and Administration
## Speaker(s): Reeves Smith
## Title: A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS
## Description:
### Testing is a critical part of the release process and vital to a high-quality data management lifecycle. Unfortunately, Integration Services (SSIS) does not have built-in support for testing and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered. 
In this session, a new approach to unit testing (focusing on verifying the correctness of individual packages, tasks, or dataflows) and integration testing (focusing on validating that the data produced by an entire sequence of transformations) will be discussed. This development pattern uses metadata authored by analysts to automatically generate testing logic within the corresponding packages or to automatically generate standalone test packages that contain all of the necessary validation logic.

## Speaker(s): Leila Etaati
## Title: Show Me Potential Customers: Data Mining Approach
## Description:
### In the most marketing departments, the tactical question is about who are going to buy our products. It is more cost effective to identify and spend money on highly potential customers (than those who are not likely to purchase). This also affects the advertisement strategy. Potential customers and their traits can be identified by analysing previous purchasing information. Management experts can predict who is going to be their new customers by analysing their current customer purchase information. There are many data mining algorithms which can help with this task. Microsoft Business Intelligence employs data mining algorithms that are deployed in an easy to use environment. This demonstration based session will show how to use previous customer purchase information to predict potential customers. We will discuss
how to set data sets and use different data mining algorithms to get predictive results and then demonstrate how to find the best predictions.

## Description:
### Personal, heroic deeds, and the right gadgets are the making of a true superhero. In this day-long pre-conference session, learn how Power BI can enable the superhero in you to thwart evil deeds - aka "no data", "old data," and the all-too-common "incomplete data."

The aim of this session is to excite you with the potential of Microsoft's new self-service suite of BI products and collaboration platform, called Power BI. You will learn about four “Power” authoring products available in Excel and how they function to discover, acquire, transform, relate, and enrich data for analysis and reporting. Topics include Power Query, PowerPivot, Power View, and Power Map.

You will also learn how to effectively share and collaborate on Power BI solutions in the cloud with Office 365. Topics include data refresh to on-premise data, the data catalog to search for data queries, natural language query (Q&A) to intuitively query data, and a mobile application for Power BI.

This session has been designed to provide perspective across the Power BI story. Theory and an end-to-end series of real-world demonstrations will allow you to appreciate how the Power BI products span on-premise and cloud environments and how they attain super-strength as they work together.

## Speaker(s): Michael Frandsen
## Title: High Performance Infrastructure for SQL Server 2014
## Description:
### Since SQL Server 2012 came out, a paradigm shift has occurred in how SQL Server platforms are designed and built. Come and hear why you will no longer need a SAN to create a high-available SQL Server and why I/O is no longer a problem.

In this session, we will discuss the new storage features in Windows Server 2012 and R2 and how they relate to SQL Server 2012 and how SQL Server 2014 expands on this.

In working with the Core Windows Server team in Redmond during the development of Windows 8/2012 and 8.1/R2, the presenter did a lot of work with technologies which have been around for some time, but unavailable to Windows Server installations. We will talk about InfiniBand, SMB, Multi-path I/O, RDMA, RoCE, NAND Flash storage, latency and much more.

Having worked on the development of SQL Server 2014 and Win8.1, the speaker will share completely new concepts of integration between SQL Server and modern hardware.
A sneak peek of Windows 10 and SQL Server vNext will be touched

Event Date: 02-03-2015 00:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Itzik Ben-Gan
## Title: Practical T-SQL: Efficient Solutions
## Description:
### T-SQL was named the most popular programming language in 2013. If you work with SQL Server in any capacity, as a developer, DBA, BI specialist, analyst, power user, you need to know your T-SQL. The thing is, this language is deceptive. When you start learning it you quickly get to write queries with filters, sorting, grouping, joining, and so on. You might get a false sense of confidence and the wrong impression that the language is easy to master. In reality, most get to learn T-SQL without understanding the fundamentals correctly, and this incorrect understanding can lead to using the language incorrectly. Often people assume things about the language that are not guaranteed, and end up with bugs in their code.

This full-day seminar is dedicated to correct understanding of T-SQL querying fundamentals. You will learn about the principal elements in the foundations of the language. You will learn about logical query processing—what I find to be the most critical aspect of T-SQL that any T-SQL practitioner should master. Then the seminar covers fundamentals of query constructs like joins, subqueries, table expressions (derived tables, CTEs, views, table valued functions), the APPLY operator, and set operators. If time will permit, the seminar will also cover the fundamentals of more specialized query constructs like PIVOT, UNPIVOT, grouping sets and window functions.

Know your T-SQL querying fundamentals well, and then tackling advanced problems will be so much easier.

Event Date: 02-03-2015 00:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: Query Performance Tuning: Start to Finish 
## Description:
### One of the most common problems encountered in SQL Server is the slow-running query. Once a query is identified as performing poorly, DBAs and developers frequently don’t understand how to diagnose the problem and struggle to fix it. This full-day seminar focuses exclusively on these two topics: You will learn how to identify queries that are performing badly and how to fix them.

We will start by covering how to gather query performance metrics using tools available directly from Microsoft, such as dynamic management objects and extended events. We’ll then move into common performance problems, how they show themselves in the metrics and execution plans, and how to address them. You will leave with a working knowledge of query performance tuning, a set of methods for identifying poorly performing queries, scripts to help out, and the knowledge you need to fix your own systems.

# Advanced Analytics with Azure Machine Learning, SQL Data Mining, and R
#### [Back to calendar](#id-39)
Event Date: 02-03-2015 00:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development and Administration
## Speaker(s): Rafal Lukawiecki
## Title: Advanced Analytics with Azure Machine Learning, SQL Data Mining, and R
## Description:
### Data mining and machine learning are having their renaissance: after more than 40 years of academic research those powerful, algorithmic techniques are finally within the reach of anyone who can understand data. They are fast, inexpensive and, best of all, they find patterns and they can generate insight that business people are asking for! Rafal Lukawiecki (https://projectbotticelli.com/?pk_campaign=pb2014passdk) will share his decade of hands-on data mining experience during this intensive, full-day seminar as he teaches you about the newest, cloud-based Microsoft analytical toolkit: Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) and its very useful on-prem companion, the SQL Server Data Mining engine contained in SSAS, supplemented with gentle "I am really not a statistician" use of the open source R software. While you might catch a glimpse of Excel this day will not focus on it, as we will spend 90% of our time in SSDT, SSMS, R, and, of course, in ML Studio. However, before we can have fun exploring patterns and making predictions, you must understand how a somewhat unusual (for a relational guy or a girl) form of data preparation leads to finding interesting, potentially great predictive results. We will cover:

•	Introduction to predictive analytics, data mining, machine learning, and rudimentary descriptive statistics, as well as data and content types used in the process (this will be at level 200)
•	Data preparation, model building, and its very important validation, on-premise, using SQL Server Data Mining (level 300)
•	Model building and testing in the cloud, using Azure ML (level 250)
•	Use and deployment of both on-premise models (using T-SQL and DMX) and cloud-based models (using REST web services API) at level 300
•	A level 300-400+ look into the specifics of a few interesting and useful algorithms, including Regression and Classification Decision Trees, Random Forests and Jungles, Association Rules, Neural Networks and Logistic Regression, and a brief, level 400+ look at balancing model performance to user requirements by selecting the correct sensitivity vs specificity thresholds.  

At the end of the day you will have learned the entire process of machine learning and data mining, focusing on the often missed out part of correct data preparation, which should enable you to start experimenting with your own data straight away. Although we cannot promise that, we will also do our best to make sure you are tired, as this will be a very intensive day, so please sign up if you like the idea of learning lots in a short span of time.

Event Date: 02-03-2015 00:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Database and Application Development
## Speaker(s): Guy Glantser
## Title: How to Use Parameters Like a Pro and Boost Performance
## Description:
### Parameters are a fundamental part of T-SQL programming, whether they are used in stored procedures, in dynamic statements or in ad-hoc queries. Although widely used, most people aren't aware of the crucial influence they have on query performance. In fact, wrong use of parameters is one of the common reasons for poor application performance.
In this session we will learn about plan caching and how the query optimizer handles parameters. We will talk about the pros and cons of parameter sniffing as well as about simple vs. forced parameterization. But most important – we will learn how to identify performance problems caused by poor parameter handling, and we will also learn many techniques for solving these problems and boosting your application performance.

## Speaker(s): John Martin
## Title: SQL Server AlwaysOn in a Multi-site World
## Description:
### Multi-site configurations are the natural progression from the more orthodox Failover Cluster Instances that form the basis previous High Availability configurations.

With the introduction of Availability Groups and Multi-subnet capability with SQL Server 2012  it is now even easier to build a multi-site & multi-subnet solution.

With this ease of deployment it is more important than ever to look at the important configuration options that can have a big impact in multi-site implementations but not in single-site. Covering things like Asymmetric storage configurations, DNS considerations and the advances in clustering.

By the end of this session, you will be in a position to confidently start building out multi-site Highly Available and effective Disaster Recovery solutions that meet the complex needs of your business, for on-premises, hybrid and cloud based deployments.

## Speaker(s): Kevin Boles
## Title: SQL Server Unit Testing
## Description:
### In the nearly 20 years I have been working with SQL Server, most of that as an independent consultant, I can count on two hands the number of clients I have come across that had ANY database tests constructed.  I can count on TWO FINGERS the number of them that had repeatable database tests.  Even the most ardent Agile/Scrum/pick-your-new-and-shiny-development-mantra shops hardly ever do anything more than wave a magic wand at testing the database, because it can be REALLY HARD to do and do correctly.  In this session we will cover examples of why repeatable database testing is CRITICALLY important and then examine a free framework that makes it both viable and straight-forward to create meaningful, repeatable SQL Server Unit Tests!

## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Now Where Does THAT Estimate Come From?
## Description:
### The SQL Server Query Optimizer makes its plan choices based on estimated rowcounts. If those estimates are wrong, the optimizer will very likely produce a poor plan. And there's nothing you can do about it. Or is there?
In this session, you will learn exactly where these estimates come from. You will gain intimate knowledge of how statistics are used to estimate row counts, and how filters and joins further influence those estimates.
Though the focus of this session is on understanding the cause of bad estimates, you will also learn some ways to fix the problems and get better estimates - and hence, better performing queries.

## Speaker(s): Joe Chang
## Title: Automating Execution Plan Analysis
## Description:
### While it is easy to practice ad-hoc SQL Server performance tuning by querying the DMVs, there are reasons to automate the collection of sufficient state information including details in the execution plans to both diagnose and resolve most common problems. Data can be collected with minimal effort, so this should be done even when there are no problems. It is practical to conduct a full analysis of the complete set of SQL/stored procedures to not just ensure that there are good indexes, but also determine the minimal set of indexes. Most (all?) performance tools seem to stop at finding the problem query. ExecStats gathers sufficient information to actually solve problems.
