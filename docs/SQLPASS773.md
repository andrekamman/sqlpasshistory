# Last Season's Performance Tuning Techniques
#### [Back to calendar](#id-773)
Event Date: 19-07-2017 12:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Perform
## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar, Erik Darling
## Title: Last Season's Performance Tuning Techniques
## Description:
### You're kinda-sorta comfortable doing performance tuning on SQL Server. You've read a few blogs, you monitor Page Life Expectancy, you rebuild your indexes, and you add an index here or there. However, you haven't been to a day-long performance tuning class yet, and you're wondering what you're missing.Thing is, in SQL Server, performance tuning changes fast. One day Perfmon counters are in, and the next day they're out. It's totally okay if you're still using SQL Server 2008 - that's not the problem. You shouldn't be wearing hammer pants, and you shouldn't be looking at PLE, monitoring Disk Queue Length, or putting your data and log files on separate drives.In this rapid-fire session, we'll show you specific examples of why performance tuning tips and tricks have fallen out of fashion, and why they're not too legit to quit.

# Create and Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour with Biml
#### [Back to calendar](#id-773)
Event Date: 19-07-2017 13:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Build
## Speaker(s): Scott Currie
## Title: Create and Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour with Biml
## Description:
### Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) automates your BI patterns and eliminates the manual repetition that consumes most of your SSIS development time. During this hour long presentation, Scott Currie from Varigence will use the free BimlExpress add-in for SSDT to introduce Biml and use to automatically generate large quantities of custom SSIS packages. The session will be largely demonstration driven, and reusable sample code will be distributed for you to use in your own projects. Using a live-typing approach, Scott will start from scratch and by the end of the session create a full-blown staging environment. This will include the creation of *hundreds* of target table creation scripts, data load packages, data scrubbing rules, logging, and more. The best part is that you can freely reuse the code in your own environment just by changing the connection strings - or make small changes to implement your own data load patterns.

# Writing User Stories and Slicing Epics for DW/BI Teams
#### [Back to calendar](#id-773)
Event Date: 19-07-2017 14:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Build
## Speaker(s): Lynn Winterboer
## Title: Writing User Stories and Slicing Epics for DW/BI Teams
## Description:
### Agile is all the rage in software development, and many data warehousing and business intelligence (DW/BI) professionals are interested in leveraging Agile approaches to change the way they deliver value to their organizations. One of the first things we learn about in a book or course on Agile is replacing "requirements" with "user stories", yet the examples provided are usually not relevant to the data world. This can leave us somewhat skeptical about whether this approach to requirements would work for DW/BI projects.

This session shares how to write user stories for a DW/BI project, and explains how these user stories contribute to several key Agile principles:
? Satisfy customers through early and continuous delivery
? Working BI features are our primary measure of progress
? Business people and the delivery team work together regularly

Attendees will leave understanding what a well-written DW/BI user story looks like.

## Speaker(s): Oscar Li
## Title: Introduction to Global Data Quality 
## Description:
### In an increasingly globalized data driven world, you may already know of the impact of data growing at an exponential rate. The amount of data in the data pond is doubling every year, and that quickly changes how we approach and understand data. Additionally, emerging global markets introduces problematic international data sets that traditional data quality methods do not always address definitively. Learn about the fundamentals of a data quality life cycle and best practices to approach international data sets with technologies like SSIS and SQL Server.

# Why Did My Clever Index Change Backfire? (Preview)
#### [Back to calendar](#id-773)
Event Date: 19-07-2017 16:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Build
## Speaker(s): Kendra Little
## Title: Why Did My Clever Index Change Backfire? (Preview)
## Description:
### SQL Server is full of advanced techniques to build powerful indexes: indexed views, filtered indexes, columnstore indexes, and more. But many of these techniques have risks: your cool indexing idea may backfire and leave your users frustrated. In this preview session, you'll see a few demos of how different indexing patterns may slow down queries, have dangerous side effects, or not work at all. If you have a solid knowledge of index basics and are comfortable reading query execution plans, this session will improve your index tuning skills.

# DevOps and the Agile DBA
#### [Back to calendar](#id-773)
Event Date: 19-07-2017 17:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Support
## Speaker(s): Kellyn Pot'Vin-Gorman
## Title: DevOps and the Agile DBA
## Description:
### DevOps came out of the Agile movement and the idea that operations needed to be part of the solution for agile development to be successful. The DBA was often the most resilient and robust member of the operations team and most resistant to change. This mentality was essential to the protection of company’s critical production data. This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”. We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration. 

The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
- Develop, Rinse, Repeat
- Test Until Your Five Year Old Can Do It
- Human Intervention Creates Human Error- Automate EVERYTHING
- How the shorter development cycle build business success
- How the DBA can do more with less.

Discover the power of virtualization and powerful agile development practices providing more value to even the most senior database expert. We’ll demo different scenarios surrounding DevOps, virtualization and how to make the DBA pivotal to DevOps success.

## Title: The SQL Server 2017 Availability Story on Linux
## Description:
### Although the paint on SQL Server 2016 just finished drying, the next version of SQL Server – SQL Server 2017 –  is almost here. One of the biggest changes is that SQL Server will be supported on Linux in addition to Windows Server. This means that all of the considerations we have for deploying instances and databases will be relevant and possibly different on Linux, including how we make SQL Server installations highly available. This session will cover the availability options for Linux-based SQL Server deployments, interoperability with Windows-based deployments, and known tips and gotchas. If you want to get a head start with availability for SQL Server on Linux, this session is for you.

## Speaker(s): Erin Stellato
## Title: Help me, Query Store. You're My Only Hope
## Description:
### The Query Store feature in SQL Server is marketed as a flight recorder for your database. It's the black box in an airplane; it's Obi-Wan Kenobi to Princess Leia in A New Hope.  But you don't have to be a Jedi to know how to use it.  

In this preview of my full-day workshop on Query Store, you'll learn how to find regressed and problematic queries using the Query Store data.  We’ll look at the information that SQL Server captures and see how to use the SSMS reports and catalog views to find the worst offenders.  No longer will you have to flail about, trying to find the issue.  After this session you’ll be able to quickly and confidently pinpoint the problem.

Event Date: 20-07-2017 03:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Perform
## Speaker(s): David Klee
## Title: Virtual CPUs: Right to Ludicrous Speed
## Description:
### One of the largest points of contention with virtual SQL Servers and the VM administrators is how to configure the CPUs. Experience says more CPUs are better for performance. VM admins say less is better. Third-party vendors say you need all of them (and it doesn’t matter how many your hosts have either). Can over-provisioning virtual machine CPUs speed things up, or does it slow things down? What is the right methodology to determine the correct number of virtual CPUs? How does this configuration align with the physical servers? From sampling and analyzing performance data, to “right-sizing’ your SQL Server virtual machine CPU count, to properly aligning the VM with the physical server NUMA topology, you will gain the understanding of how to properly manage and validate your virtual SQL Server vCPU configuration in this insightful session. Valuable tips and tricks will be shared that you can take back to your virtual SQL Servers and immediately apply to your own environments.

## Speaker(s): Kenneth Urena
## Title: Azure SQL VM - Implementing Basic AG in SQL 2016 STD
## Description:
### For a long time Database Professionals have been asking Microsoft to make Always on Availability Groups (AG) available in Standard Edition. With SQL Server 2016 SP1, Microsoft responded with Basic Availability Groups, a limited but very functional version of Always on Availability Groups.

Basic Availability Groups enable Data Professionals to provide enterprise class High Availability solutions using SQL Server Standard Edition, which allows organizations to save money by providing High Availability (HA) for applications that require HA without paying for SQL Server Enterprise Edition features they do not need.

In this session, we will be covering:
- Limitations on Basic Availability Groups
- Components and steps necessary to configure a Basic AG for an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) running SQL Server 2016

## Speaker(s): Cathrine Wilhelmsen
## Title: Tools and Tips: From Accidental to Efficient Data Warehouse Developer
## Description:
### You have probably heard about the Accidental DBA, but what about the Accidental Data Warehouse Developer? We stumbled into the world of data warehousing, learned dimensional modeling and work with T-SQL and SSIS daily. We are masters of googling solutions to our problems and making sure our ETL processes run without errors. We deliver data to business users… and the more we deliver, the more they want. This is a good thing! But how do we keep up with the increased demand?

You might not be able to rewrite your entire ETL process or change your team's processes over night, but there are many things you can do to increase your own productivity and become a more efficient and valuable Data Warehouse developer.

In this session, I will show you some of what I have learned and discovered that has made me say "Oh wow! Why did I not know this yesterday!?" - including SSMS features, tools for query analysis and tuning, free tools and scripts, Biml for SSIS and even a couple of things I used to think were only useful for those scary DBAs.

## Speaker(s): Kathi Kellenberger
## Title: SQL Server Data Compression
## Description:
### When I first heard about data compression back when it was introduced with SQL Server 2008, I thought that it would be a performance killer. But did you know that data compression can actually improve performance? I've wanted to recommend it many of my customers over the years but often couldn't because they were running Standard Edition. Starting with SQL Server 2016 SP1, data compression is available in all editions. Now any size shop and budget can take advantage of this great feature.

# A Guided Tour of the SqlClient Namespace
#### [Back to calendar](#id-773)
Event Date: 20-07-2017 10:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Scale
## Speaker(s): Jay Robinson
## Title: A Guided Tour of the SqlClient Namespace
## Description:
### The prototypical bridge between Transact-SQL and .NET languages is the Framework's SqlClient namespace. As developers, how well do we really know that bridge? Let's face it - sometimes we take a careful, deliberate approach to our code, and sometimes we simply copy/paste code snippets from StackExchange and move on to the next problem. That approach may work in the short term, but its success as the application grows and matures is a roll of the dice. Do you want to take this gamble with your data access code, or do you want to be confident that it will scale? A deeper understanding of the SqlClient namespace will help you write more robust code now, saving you from rewriting it later, under pressure, when the gamble doesn't pay off.

This session is a survey of some of the vital elements of the SqlClient namespace, and, depending on your experience, may serve as an introduction, a refresher, or a new perspective on a part of the .NET Framework that is often taken for granted. Demos will use C#, though the principles can be applied in any of the .NET languages.

Some Selected Topics:
- Connection pooling strategies
- Nuances of the SqlDataReader class
- Proper handling of SQL Server exceptions
- Effective use of the SqlBulkCopy class

Following this session, attendees should be better prepared to develop scalable and reliable solutions that use the .NET Framework to communicate with SQL Server databases.

Event Date: 20-07-2017 11:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Build
## Speaker(s): Gail Shaw
## Title: On Transactions and Atomic Operations
## Description:
### "If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers don’t do, it’s use transactions as often as we should.

Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code

In this session, we’ll look at what transactions are and why we should use them. We’ll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We’ll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we’ll see why nested transactions are a lie.

1) Understand what transactions are and what they do.

2) Learn how to use transactions in combination with error handling to roll back changes on errors

3) Learn how transactions affect logging and locking.
