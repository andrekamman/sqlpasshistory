Event Date: 17-10-2018 16:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing
## Speaker(s): Scot Reagin
## Title: Data Positioning: Self-Defense or a Brilliant New Architecture
## Description:
### The Cloud, streaming data, big data, self-service, machine learning, AI and the internet of things.  Clearly, we’re not in Data Management Kansas anymore.  Data Modelers and Architects have been reacting to wave after wave of demands from these communities with new technologies and methodologies but too often remain grounded in outdated concepts of data management principles.  Data Positioning is an evolution of this thinking, allowing Data Managers to deliver value today and in the future.

## Speaker(s): Sergiy Lunyakin
## Title: Big Data Analytics Reference Architectures
## Description:
### Big Data is a hot topic nowadays. But, how to design robust and scalable architecture according to business needs? Could we use Traditional Analytics (BI) approach here? Let's dive together and learn how to use Attribute-Driven Design approach in order to identify key architecture drivers and map it with reference architectures. We also will look at technologies as building blocks for those architectures and some practical use cases for better understanding how it works.

# Adding Data Quality to a Kimball Data Warehouse
#### [Back to calendar](#id-939)
Event Date: 17-10-2018 19:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing
## Speaker(s): Robert Hart
## Title: Adding Data Quality to a Kimball Data Warehouse
## Description:
### With ever increasing volumes of Data and the demand for more information in shorter timeframes, the need for addressing Data Quality is becoming more critical. The presence of invalid data to the decision making process can be worse than no data. This presentation introduces a design architecture that can be easily added to a small to mid-size Kimball data warehouse that allows not only the ability to capture and measure data quality issues, but relate them to your existing fact and dimension tables. Practical examples from a health care environment will show how one organizations measure of data quality achieved better than 99% acceptance rate for government mandated reporting.
