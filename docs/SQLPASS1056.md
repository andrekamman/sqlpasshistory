## Speaker(s): Geovanny Hernandez
## Title: How you can Keep your SQL Code Protected with GIT
## Description:
### Imagine that you have been hard working in that amazing project, your SQL code has been tuned and contains new features and followed the standard that will be crucial for the success of this project. The deploy date has arrived and you have deployed early in the morning but some minutes after the deploy, the users started to call for reporting several issues in the different systems which are using the Databases that were part of your deployment, after stressful minutes, you realized some SQL code deployed was not the same that were tested and you must rollback your code. 

In this session, I'm going to show you how to avoid problems derived of mistakes during the development process through the proper use of source control code strategy which can combine the potential of GIT and SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) for managing latest version, detecting changes, code review and deploying through environment without stress.

## Title: Bringing AI to the Edge: On-premise Azure Cognitive Services 
## Description:
### Azure Cognitive Services allow developers to build powerful AI-based solutions, enabling different capabilities in our software: vision. speech, search, text analytics, language understanding, and much more. Basically, the model is already built by Microsoft, you just need to do an API call to the Azure cloud and the service retrieves a result. For instance, you send a message and the Text Analytics API returns its sentiment score.

However, there might be cases in which our customers need a local, non-cloud AI solution (either because of limited Internet access or data compliance). This is now possible thanks to the latest update of Azure Cognitive Services, which offers containerization support. Using containers, we can still deliver ML-driven solutions while keeping the data in-house.

In this talk, we'll explore what it takes to configure and use containers in Azure Cognitive Services. Demos will be showcased as well for local Face and Text Cognitive Services.
