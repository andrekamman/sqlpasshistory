# Relational Database Design Workshop

Event Date: 05-11-2012 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Relational Database Design Workshop
## Description:
### Database design is a seemingly natural process, leading everyone to try to do it themselves, from an administrative assistant with a spreadsheet to a C# programmer with a copy of SQL Server Express. Unfortunately, the finer points of excellent database design are not intuitively obvious, and the difference between building a spreadsheet and a solid enterprise database is like the difference between building a doghouse and a two-story house, or even the Empire State Building.

To design a database correctly, there are several things you need to know, including the basics of relational theory, how to gather and apply requirements, normalization, etc. While having a good foundation in the fundamentals is more than many database designers have, it is only the start. In this workshop, we will go to the next level and get our hands dirty designing databases.

## Speaker(s): Devin Knight, Brian Knight
## Title: Building a SQL Server 2012 BI Platform
## Description:
### In this day-long deep-dive seminar, you'll learn how to build a Business Intelligence solution for your company and support it with the Microsoft platform. We'll start with how to design and data model a data warehouse, including the system preparation. Then, we'll jump into using SQL Server Integration Services to load the data warehouse.

After the data warehouse is loaded, you're ready to roll up the data and provide slice and dice reporting with SQL Server Analysis Services. We'll walk through cube development and enriching your cubes with added business metrics, which are essential for your future dashboards. Last, we'll cover how to report against the data warehouse with SQL Server Reporting Services and SharePoint BI.

## Speaker(s): Klaus Aschenbrenner
## Title: Practical SQL Server Performance Troubleshooting
## Description:
### Learn how to configure the Windows OS, SQL Server, and your database for optimal performance. In this pre-conference workshop, we'll start by taking a default installation of SQL Server and running an OLTP workload with several hundred users to generate our initial baseline for performance tuning and troubleshooting. Throughout the day, we'll work with various areas of SQL Server to implement different performance optimizations and then see how those changes impact the throughput of our initial test workload. At the end of the day, we'll have a well-performing SQL Server that can handle a much larger workload than the initial (default) installation.

Topics for the day include:
• Windows OS settings
• Storage configuration
• SQL Server instance settings
• Database settings
• Index and statistics maintenance
• Locking, blocking, and deadlocking
• Memory management

#### [Back to calendar](#id-17)
Event Date: 05-11-2012 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Robert Davis, Argenis Fernandez
## Title: Demystifying Database Administration Best Practices
## Description:
### Being able to evaluate and develop best practices is a critical skill for DBAs. Early in our careers, we followed best practices because people who claimed to know more about SQL Server told us to. Then we realized that for most best practices we found, we could find the opposite advice posted elsewhere. We started evaluating best practices ourselves and began cultivating our own set of best practices. 

This workshop is a culmination of what we’ve learned through our experiences, testing, and understanding of how SQL Server operates. We will touch on best practices for all aspects of the DBA realm, from AD configuration to Windows Server deployments to SQL installs, with configuration settings galore. We will cover the "why's" behind the best practices, tips to make your daily duties easier, and what to look for in code reviews. And we’ll show you how to evaluate best practices for yourself.

## Speaker(s): Allen White
## Title: Automate and Manage SQL Server with PowerShell
## Description:
### This soup-to-nuts all-day introduction to PowerShell for the SQL Server DBA will start with the basics of PowerShell and teach you the fundamental SMO object model, how to manipulate data with PowerShell, and how to use SMO to manage objects. We'll then move on to creating Policy-Based Management policies, working with the Central Management Server, managing your system inventory, and gathering performance data with PowerShell.

We'll wrap up with a look at the new PowerShell cmdlets introduced for SQL Server 2012 and how you can use PowerShell to manage SQL Server 2012 in server environments, including the new AlwaysOn technology and Windows Server Core. At the end of the day, you'll be ready to put PowerShell to work automating and managing SQL Server in your organization.

## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt, Ben DeBow
## Title: Real-World System Design for the DBA: Private Cloud and SQL as a Service
## Description:
### Performing. Agile. Available. Reliable. Easy to manage. Cost-effective. These words describe things we all strive for, but often don't achieve for our SQL Server deployments and environments for one reason or another. Every DBA should have this goal: Provide high service levels and the agility to meet customer demands with the least amount of risk, cost, time, and effort.

You can standardize your configurations and offerings with the right planning and knowledge of your environment. But transforming the way you work from a purely administrative focus to running your DBA services more like a company is where the private cloud and SQL as a Service (SaaS) come into play. Join us to learn how to properly plan, deploy, and maintain SQL Server systems to support your company’s needs, whether you are using physical servers, virtualization, or both.

# Query Performance Tuning: Start to Finish
#### [Back to calendar](#id-17)
Event Date: 06-11-2012 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: Query Performance Tuning: Start to Finish
## Description:
### One of the most common problems encountered in SQL Server is the slow-running query. Once a query is identified as performing poorly, DBAs and developers frequently don’t understand how to diagnose the problem and struggle to fix it. This full-day seminar focuses exclusively on these two topics: You will learn how to identify queries that are performing badly and how to fix them.

We will start by covering how to gather query performance metrics using tools available directly from Microsoft, such as dynamic management objects and extended events. We’ll then move into common performance problems, how they show themselves in the metrics and execution plans, and how to address them. You will leave with a working knowledge of query performance tuning, a set of methods for identifying poorly performing queries, scripts to help out, and the knowledge you need to fix your own systems.

## Speaker(s): Itzik Ben-Gan
## Title: T-SQL Querying and Query Tuning Enhancements in SQL Server 2005-2012
## Description:
### As a DBA or database developer, you usually undergo a number of learning phases when it comes to new T-SQL features. You typically start by learning the logical aspects of the feature, then the practical uses, and finally optimization. With time, you identify best practices, discover more advanced optimizations, and find other creative ways to use the feature.

The more experience you have with a feature, the more interesting uses you find - the APPLY operator and ROW_NUMBER function are great examples of this. The newer the feature, such as the new and enhanced window functions, the more discoveries await you. This seminar will cover T-SQL querying and query tuning enhancements in the latest major releases of SQL Server, including window functions, sequences, OFFSET/FETCH, MERGE, grouping sets, date and time types and functions, APPLY, pivoting and unpivoting, CTEs, columnstore indexes, filtered indexes, and more!

## Title: Zero to BI Semantic Model with SQL Server 2012
## Description:
### Get the know-how you need to deliver state-of-the-art data models using SQL Server 2012 Analysis Services. This pre-conference session will teach you the theory behind Analysis Services BI Semantic Models and demonstrate how to design, develop, deploy, and manage them.

We'll cover all three development approaches: multidimensional, tabular with the tabular project, and tabular with PowerPivot. These different approaches give you choice and flexibility, but which should you use when? We'll look at the benefits and limitations of each approach in detail so that you can make an informed decision about which data model to use.

## Speaker(s): Jerome Halmans, Gus Apostol
## Title: SQLCAT:  SQLOS Memory Manager Changes in SQL Server 2012
## Description:
### SQLOS is an internal user-mode OS enrichment layer for SQL Server that delivers system-level services such as cooperative user mode scheduling, memory management, deadlock detection, and exception handling to SQL Server components. In SQL Server 2012, Microsoft refactored the Memory Manager subcomponent in SQLOS to let users predictably size SQL Server memory consumption, in addition to providing performance and scalability improvements.

Before this change, the 'max server memory' sp_configure option contained only one type of memory allocation (i.e., single page – 8Kb). With the Memory Manager re-architecture improvement, all types of memory allocations will be accounted for by 'max server memory'. Come learn about what this change  means for sizing memory for customer workloads in SQL Server 2012. You will also hear about related DMV and performance counter changes.

## Title: The Biggest Loser: Database Edition
## Description:
### Fat! That’s how you’d have to describe most databases these days. When databases with development, QA, and backup replicas are stored on a SAN, the cost can be tens of thousands of dollars per terabyte. In this session, you’ll learn how to trim a database by up to 75%.

This session will show you how to put your database on a diet using compression, filtered indexes, maintenance, REBUILD and REORGANIZE, index management, and application changes. Topics will include how to calculate the storage required for each row, measure the actual storage of rows, and find hidden overhead such as Snapshot Isolation bytes. You'll see how to recover extra space and why NOT to SHRINK your database files. And you'll learn why log files grow, how to keep them under control, how to shrink log files the right way, and rebuilding files to recover the unused space.

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Triggers: Born Evil or Misunderstood?
## Description:
### Triggers are almost universally derided as evil by many developers and DBAs - often for seemingly good reasons. For starters, they are not easy to write effectively, harming the overall performance of your database instance. Even worse, they commonly introduce side effects that confuse even the trigger writer.

Yet for everything bad that can be said about triggers, there is one plain fact: They solve problems that cannot be addressed effectively anywhere else in the programming stack. In this session, we will contrast triggers with other methods of protecting data, such as client code and check constraints, and look at several use cases where triggers are the preferable path of protection (and many others where the opposite is true).

## Speaker(s): Don Kiely
## Title: The Evolution of Security in SQL Server 2012
## Description:
### Microsoft rebuilt SQL Server security from the ground up in SQL Server 2005, and since then, it has evolved database security in each new version. SQL Server 2012 continues that trend with some new features that can keep your data even more secure, such as new server-level role features, new hashing algorithms, and new permissions. It also adds contained databases, which let users connect to the database without authenticating at the server level. This is a great feature that solves problems when you move databases, but it sounds scary from a security perspective.

During this session, we'll explore all the new security features in SQL Server 2012. When we're finished, you'll have everything you need to decide for yourself whether your databases will be adequately protected in SQL Server 2012 - or if security is getting way too onerous in SQL Server.

## Title: Developers Are from Mars, Report Servers Are from Venus
## Description:
### At first, you loved working with Reporting Services, but now the honeymoon's over. What good are charts and tables when Reporting Services won't tell you what's wrong, renders too slow, and messes up your layout? You may be thinking about seeing other reporting products, but don't give up.

In this couples therapy for you and Reporting Services, rekindle your passion by reviewing how reports perform best, seeing what the report server has been trying to tell you (but you haven't been listening), and discovering new and simple tricks you never knew your reports could do. You'll learn about the following and more:

• Dealing with blank extra pages
• Designing reports for high performance
• Powerful properties for precise layout and appearance
• Troubleshooting using the execution log

After this session, you'll want to spend some time alone with your new old flame.

## Title: Tempdb: Performance and Manageability
## Description:
### Misconceptions and inconsistent advice on tempdb abounds – even highly skilled DBAs cannot always agree on how to best configure it. Part of the problem is that there is no single solution that can be applied to every situation. How many files should tempdb have? Should it be on RAID 1? RAID 10? How about Solid State Drives (SSDs)? This session will give you the tools to determine the optimal configuration for tempdb. We'll also cover how to detect, prevent, and monitor for common tempdb performance problems.

## Speaker(s): Alberto Ferrari
## Title: Querying and Optimizing DAX 
## Description:
### In SQL Server 2012, DAX became a query language, and when it comes to performance, the xVelocity in-memory engine is second to none. Scanning fact tables and performing leaf-level computation happens in a matter of milliseconds. But as with any language, you can write good DAX or bad DAX, depending on your understanding of the engine internals.

This session will introduce DAX as a query language, showing you the different ways of querying with DAX using real-world data. Some queries will be fast, others will need optimizations and a better understanding of query plans. We'll look at it all to give you a complete understanding of how to get the most out of DAX.

## Speaker(s): Mindy Curnutt
## Title: SQL I/O Uh-Oh
## Description:
### A little planning can go a long way. This session will cover the importance of up-front planning in regard to disk quantity, RAID choice, stripe width, alignment, and block size. We'll also discuss Random vs. Sequential I/O, file quantity, placement, and log isolation. You'll see exactly what to look for and how at each step along the way. Remember: You normally get one chance to get the disk right – don’t  don't miss that chance! It is more critical than many people realize. Poor configuration can hold you back by 30% or more on performance. We'll finish up with a musical ditty to help you remember the main points of the session.

# How to Defragment Indexes for Peak Performance
#### [Back to calendar](#id-17)
Event Date: 08-11-2012 13:30 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Brad McGehee
## Title: How to Defragment Indexes for Peak Performance
## Description:
### Over time, as indexes experience INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs, a normal process called index fragmentation occurs in OLTP databases. Index fragmentation can cause gaps on data pages that waste disk and data cache space; this is called internal fragmentation. It can also scatter pages throughout the database as the logical and physical order of the pages get out of synch, called external fragmentation. Together, these factors can result in heavy index fragmentation, which can reduce query performance.

In this session, you will learn how index fragmentation occurs, how it causes performance problems, how to determine index fragmentation, and different ways indexes can be defragmented. We will look at the pros and cons of REBUILD and REORGANIZE, how index defragmentation and statistics work together, and even how to reduce index fragmentation in the first place.

## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: Near Real-Time Analytics with xVelocity (without DirectQuery) 
## Description:
### Real-time analytical systems are challenging, but interesting. The classic solution for real-time systems is to build ROLAP partitions, so you have a MOLAP cache with consolidated data and a ROLAP partition for fresh information. However, with the Tabular model in Analysis Services 2012, there's no option for this solution. You must go either in-memory or with DirectQuery, making DirectQuery the only available choice for real-time analytics.

But is DirectQuery really the only option? By using partitions in a clever way and pushing the process time to its limits, it is possible to obtain good performance for near real-time systems. This session will show you the techniques for this solution and analyze how close we can get to real-time analysis by using in-memory databases.

## Speaker(s): Brad McGehee
## Title: Configuring the OS for Optimal SQL Server Performance
## Description:
### DBAs often become focused on SQL Server and forget about other components of the SQL Server ecosystem that are important for troubleshooting and performance tuning, especially the OS. SQL Server runs on top of the OS, thus the OS has a significant influence on SQL Server’s operation, security, and performance.

In this session, you will learn how the OS works with and affects SQL Server, how to configure the OS so it helps, rather than hinders, SQL Server’s performance, and how to troubleshoot key OS-related issues than can directly affect SQL Server. This session assumes you have minimal OS experience and focuses only on the areas of the OS that you need to understand to help ensure SQL Server’s optimal performance and availability.

## Speaker(s): David DeWitt
## Title: Big Data Meets SQL Server
## Description:
### During my “Big Data” keynote at the 2011 PASS conference, I introduced the concept of an “enterprise data manager” - a new class of database systems capable of executing queries against both traditional structured data stored in a relational DBMS and unstructured data stored in HDFS, Hadoop’s distributed file system.    In this talk I will describe the progress we have been making on this concept at the Gray Systems Lab.   Extending the Query Processor in SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse by adding a new table distribution type for data stored in HDFS, we give it the ability to query data stored in HDFS without first having to load the data into PDW.  By leveraging a database QP, we can perform real optimization - transform selections, projections, aggregates and other operations on HDFS files into MapReduce jobs and execute them on the Hadoop cluster as part of the query execution plan it generates.

## Title: Parent-Child Hierarchies in Tabular 
## Description:
### Users love parent-child hierarchies. BI professionals sometimes hate them, because they produce some of the most challenging data models. Computing values, using unary operators, applying security, handling Slowly Changing Dimensions… all the canonical operations look more complex with parent-child. Tabular does not provide native handling of parent-child hierarchies, but by using some smart DAX code, you can produce great results. In this session, we will analyze some common and complex parent-child scenarios and solutions.

## Title: Performance Tuning Through the Plan Cache
## Description:
### After execution, execution plans are stored in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache, you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. You can use this information to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session, we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery.

## Speaker(s): Marco Russo
## Title: Inside DAX Query Plans 
## Description:
### A DAX query is usually fast, but what can you do if there is a performance problem? In theory, you can just check the DAX syntax and modify it so that if the formula engine is a bottleneck, most of the computation is moved down to the storage engine. But how exactly do you do that?

The first step is understanding the DAX Query Plan, which is provided in SQL Server Profiler but requires some understanding of the operations performed by the formula engine and the storage engine. In this session, we'll see how queries are translated into query plans and then executed by the xVelocity in-memory engine, so that you can find the potential bottlenecks in a query plan and identify optimizations.

## Title: Managed Self-Service BI
## Description:
### You know how to do Business Intelligence, right? Well kids, traditional BI is a-changin'. You heard about the ambitious data analyst down the hall who created a mashup of data from the internal data warehouse + Excel + an Azure feed? Empowering knowledge workers is Microsoft's vision of delivering "BI for the Masses." In this session, we will dismiss the hype and examine how this new world of managed self-service BI complements corporate BI in SQL Server 2012 and SharePoint 2010.

## Speaker(s): Robert Cain
## Title: SQL Server Database Projects in SQL Server 2012 Data Tools
## Description:
### Database development got completely revamped with SQL Server 2012. The former Visual Studio Database Projects have now been integrated into the all-new SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). In this session, we'll look at the tools included with SSDT, such as the localdb, database snapshots, and the new way to publish your database. You'll also learn how to reverse-engineer existing databases into your project, as well as how to do safe refactoring. Finally, we'll note the limitations around the new SSDT and ways you can work around them.

## Speaker(s): Michael Antonovich
## Title: Hello, My Name Is DAX
## Description:
### Anyone doing serious work with PowerPivot knows you must sometimes create additional columns calculated from the data in your existing data sources. If your data source is SQL Server, you can do this in SQL directly by just connecting to a custom view. However, for most other data sources (and for users without development access to SQL Server), the best alternative is building expressions in PowerPivot to define new columns. You can then use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to join tables on multiple columns and create calculated measures. This session will explore DAX functions and expressions and how they differ from Excel expressions.

## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: Deploying SQL Server 2012 Failover Clustering Instances
## Description:
### There are quite a few changes to failover clustering in SQL Server 2012, not the least of which is full multi-subnet support, the use of SMB shares, the ability to use a local tempdb, and more. Add to that mix the possibility of a new OS, and there's a lot DBAs will need to know to update their skills to deploy clustered instances with the latest version of SQL Server. This session will cover the relevant tips, tricks, and gotchas including anything related to Windows Server 2012 if possible.

## Speaker(s): Don Kiely
## Title: New Kid in Town: SQL Express LocalDB
## Description:
### SQL Express has evolved over the years, starting life as MSDB oh so very long ago. The newest kid on the block is SQL Express LocalDB, a version of SQL Express targeted squarely at developers. It purports to be easy to install and delivers all the features of the full SQL Express, providing applications with essentially an embedded database that you program against, just like a full version of SQL Server - all with no management required.

It doesn't use any Windows services, only processes used and owned by applications using an instance of the database. An application works directly with databases as files rather than as server instances. This session will explore this latest version of SQL Server and see how it works in applications, letting you decide if the new kid is a flash in the pan or an upstart that will change how you write (some) database applications.

## Speaker(s): 
## Title: Programmability and Queries in the Microsoft environment for Hadoop
## Description:
### The recent proliferation of Big Data processing has led to a variety of tools and development environments within and around the Hadoop ecosystem that target a variety of developer personalities. The Big Data Vector’s mission is to bring the Hadoop ecosystem to the Microsoft online and on-premise platforms. A crucial aspect in that mission is to democratize the developer experience of doing high-scale adhoc data analysis in the Hadoop eco-system.  We will show how we go being the strong Java-centricity and make Hadoop more approachable for non-Java developers both in the context of the Microsoft .Net programming environment as well as the general programmer experience. We will show how to use ODBC to access Hive’s SQL dialect, write Map/Reduce jobs using .Net, leverage LINQ over Hive, and will also look forward into how we plan on extending Hive’s SQL dialect and provide an interactive programming experience with JavaScript.

## Speaker(s): Tim Ford
## Title: You Can Do That with T-SQL?
## Description:
### Creativity is not limited to the "Dev" side of the SQL Server environment. In this quick-paced session, you'll see how you can mine important backup, diagnostic, file size, and schema metadata from the SQL catalog views, dynamic management objects, and system tables within master and msdb databases. 

Through fun discussions and demos, we'll explore deriving file size growth from the msdb database and collecting schema information from the catalog views and performance information over time from the dynamic management objects, among other topics. Just think how valuable it will be to give your managers or clients information about the global environment on demand. The skills, tricks, and tips in this session will let you to do just that, without too much sweat on your part.

## Speaker(s): Steve Hughes
## Title: A Window into Your Data: Using SQL Window Functions
## Description:
### Window functions are an underused feature in T-SQL that have been greatly expanded in SQL Server 2012. These functions can help you solve complex business problems such as running totals and ranking. If you have never used these functions or are looking to solve ranking and aggregate types of calculations without using GROUP BY, join this demo-filled session on how and when to use SQL window functions.
