## Speaker(s): Peter Myers
## Title: End-to-End Power BI
## Description:
### The aim of this session is to excite you with the potential of Microsoft's new self-service suite of BI products and collaboration platform named Power BI. You will learn about four “Power” authoring products available in Excel, and how they function to discover, acquire, transform, relate and enrich data for analysis and reporting. 

Topics include Power Query, PowerPivot, Power View, and Power Map. This session has been designed to provide perspective across the Power BI story.

Event Date: 05-02-2014 19:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Big Data
## Speaker(s): Stacia Varga
## Title: Has Big Data Killed the EDW?
## Description:
### Big Data technologies have given us the ability to process massive amounts of data at a low cost, and yet the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) still plays a key role in most corporate IT shops. Is it time for EDWs to transition? Or is the future of EDW doomed because we now need to solve different problems? This session will answer your questions about the future of EDW.

Event Date: 05-02-2014 20:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analysis Techniques
## Speaker(s): Dejan Sarka
## Title: Advanced Analytics in Excel 2013
## Description:
### Excel is “the” analytical tool in Microsoft’s suite for advanced analysts. Of course, you know that Excel 2013 includes PowerPivot and Power View add-ins out of the box. You also may have heard that you can use Big Data and Azure DataMarket data in Excel and that you can mash up data from different sources. However, you probably don’t know how to use PowerPivot data for data mining, how to combine Big Data with PowerPivot data, how to use data mining models in PowerPivot, or how to mash up data when you don’t have common identification. 

This session is not about introducing the cool new features; instead it will focus on the most advanced part of Excel analytics: data mining with Excel.

## Title: Panel: Myths, Misunderstandings, and Successes in Data Analytics
## Description:
### Big Data, Business Analytics, Data Analytics, NoSQL, Relational . . . do we even agree on what we mean by those terms? In this panel session, industry thought leaders will discuss and debate the most common myths, truths, and mostly-truths of new and traditional approaches for enterprise data management and analytics

## Speaker(s): Chris Webb
## Title: Power Query: Beyond the Basics
## Description:
### You already know that you can accomplish a lot within the Power Query user interface. If you are a data steward, however, you may be asked to deliver complex data sets in Power Query that require some knowledge of advanced functionality, including the M language. This session will examine what these requirements might be, how to implement them, and how best to deploy them to end users.     We will cover how to create common types of calculations in M, how to best use functions, calling to web services, and OData data sources, and more. We will also discuss the best way to use Power Query with the rest of the Power BI stack, especially PowerPivot.      &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;** We apologize for an audio issue for this recording between 27:00 – 30:00&lt;/div&gt;

## Speaker(s): Lynn Langit
## Title: Small Big Data - Phase 0 - Data Hygiene 
## Description:
### In this talk, we will talk about the starting point for every Big Data project - getting your current (data) house in order. Drawing from real-world experience, Lynn Langit will discuss patterns, tools, and techniques for improving data hygiene with SQL Server. These will include use of SSDT, 3rd party tools, such as D&B and Melissa Data, and more. 

Learn how to get ready for Big Data with practical tips from this session.

# DataViz You Thought You Could NOT Do with SSRS

Event Date: 06-02-2014 01:00 - Category: 24 Hours of PASS (60 minutes) - Track: Information Delivery
## Speaker(s): Jason Thomas
## Title: DataViz You Thought You Could NOT Do with SSRS
## Description:
### Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code. Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!

## Speaker(s): Carlos Bossy
## Title: An Introduction to Predictive Modeling
## Description:
### This session will show you how to solve a real-world data mining problem by demonstrating the entire development life cycle of a predictive model. You will learn the essentials required to harness the power of a decision tree algorithm to develop and optimize a production-ready predictive model. You will also see how to iterate through the process to improve the model’s effectiveness. Then you will learn how to make the most of a predictive model by seeing how to deploy it and use in your applications and reports
