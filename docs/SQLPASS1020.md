## Title: Data Privacy and the Data Driven Professional
## Description:
### Rapid new technological advances in the data-driven world are placing the issue of Data Privacy at the forefront of the public consciousness – forcing a discussion around the ethical use of data within business and the role that each data professional must play in ensuring that the highest standards are reached, maintained and constantly evaluated.

But what are the main issues here and what are the tools and techniques that both Microsoft and Third Parties provide us with to help overcome some of these obstacles.

This session will take a close look at some of these challenges and the tools that are available to help mitigate these issues and risks, help avoid any data misuse, large financial penalties and keep you in business and using data responsibly.

## Title: How GDPR compliant are you? – Centralized and Decentralized Duo
## Description:
### Since GDPR compliance has been a much talked about topic in the Data Privacy domain, a lot of us have been more focused in implementing centralized applications. Right to protect, right to erase, right to consumer data etc. have been a part of the broader data-privacy bandwagon; however, we have been missing out on the possibility of owning a ‘GDPR Compliant Decentralized Application’ in our futuristic view. It is never too early to discuss GDPR's reachability to the relational-non-relational-decentralized world.  This session will include data privacy and data security in Centralized Architecture [Demo featuring SQL Server 2017, SSIS, SSRS].
