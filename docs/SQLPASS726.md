## Speaker(s): Erik Veerman
## Title: Overcoming SSIS Deployment and Configuration Challenges 
## Description:
### It is no secret that a main deficiency of SSIS is deployment. Have you wanted to punch a wall before when trying to move a package from one server to another? You`re not alone. This session will be more than just SSIS deployment anger management. We`ll look at how to overcome the deployment challenges by considering configurations, package and connection security, and deployment approaches. And don`t miss the Visio decision tree that will help you down the right path depending on your situation!

# Metadata Integration of Microsoft SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS and Popular Modeling and Design Tools 
#### [Back to calendar](#id-726)
Event Date: 19-11-2008 10:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker(s): 
## Title: Metadata Integration of Microsoft SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS and Popular Modeling and Design Tools 
## Description:
### Microsoft`s data integration and business intelligence (DI and BI) suite of tools based upon the SQL Server platform (Integration, Analysis, and Reporting Services, or SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS) comprise a rich opportunity for metadata integration with other popular modeling tools. In particular, data modeling tools, such as CA ERwin Data Modeler, may contain and/or maintain the metadata required for source and/or target DI specifications in SSIS, SSAS relational databases. Other design tools, like Kalido, maintain warehouse and BI designs which may be forward engineered into SSAS. In addition, with multiple producers and consumers of metadata there is a great need for multi-vendor metadata management, as well as end-to-end lineage and impact analysis.

# Supporting Highly Concurrent Business Processes with SQL Server 2005 and 2008

## Speaker(s): Adam Machanic
## Title: Supporting Highly Concurrent Business Processes with SQL Server 2005 and 2008 
## Description:
### SQL Server 2005 and 2008 are designed to be able to massively scale, enabling support for huge, highly concurrent workloads. Thousands of users hitting your database at the same time is no problem at all. But sometimes, due to business demands, we actually need to go the other way and put controls in place to limit concurrency. This session focuses on techniques for designing your databases and applications in order to satisfy the business requirements of concurrency, rather than just shooting for a high number of transactions per second. Considering the potential business impact of our concurrency decisions brings up numerous interesting questions; for example, what happens when you need to support business processes that may last hours or days, and how do you design data workflows into your database? The session starts with a discussion of some of the designs that can contribute to concurrency problems, as well as the categories of business requirements that should be used as drivers when considering how to fix concurrency issues. We will then take a look at how SQL Server handles concurrency at the transactional level, with a quick overview of isolation levelsâ€”including the newest member of the group, snapshot isolation. We will next move on to an analysis of how to use SQL Server`s various features to help solve many of the problems that concurrency brings to the table: Database designs to support pessimistic and optimistic concurrency at the business process level, multivalue concurrency control to support versioning and snapshot views of data at the table level, and examples from a real-world project where SQL Service Broker was used as a vehicle to greatly drive up the concurrency potential of a mixed-workload application.

# How to build an effective Date dimension (in SSAS) 
#### [Back to calendar](#id-726)
Event Date: 19-11-2008 15:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence
## Speaker(s): 
## Title: How to build an effective Date dimension (in SSAS) 
## Description:
### Dates are arguably the single most important dimension in an SSAS cube. It is hard to imagine a cube without one. Date is often the most useful dimension to tie measure groups together, allowing integration of multiple sources. Dates are often one of the most problematic dimensions in an SSAS cube. Dates for different fact tables are often at different grain (e.g., orders by day, plan by month). Date dimensions often have multiple hierarchies (e.g., Calendar Month, Fiscal Week), and often need attributes split across multiple axes (e.g. Years on rows, Months on Columns). Dates dimensions often appear multiple times in different roles (e.g., Order Date, Ship Date), which multiplies the impact of less-optimal design. As if that weren`t enough, dates are very often used in calculations (e.g., growth from previous month, YTD), and the formulas are highly affected by attribute relationships, which can be particularly complex with dates. This session will teach you effective design practices for dates, and demonstrate how good design can make it much easier to create date-related formulas that work as expected.

## Title: Deploying DB Pro to Multiple Environments 
## Description:
### Description This session will show attendees a series of TSQL scripts, command line scripts and various Visual Studio settings and configurations that will enable the attendee to use Visual Studio DB Pro to deploy to multiple environments. It`s extremely easy to configure DB Pro to deploy to a single environment. However, when multiple developers or DBA`s have to deploy the same project to various disparate environments, the tool becomes more difficult to use. This session will introduce concepts to make this task easier. To begin, attendees will be introduced to project properties that need to be configured to allow for multiple environments. This will also introduce the concept of variables within the DB Pro environment. Visual Studio Configuration Manager will be covered as a method for establishing different settings for different environments. The session will move on to show how the Pre and Post deployment scripts can be manipulated to deal with the requirements of different environments with an emphasis on file placement and security. Command line builds using parameters will be shown. These make all of the previous concepts available for automation. Finally, a method for saving all this information and sharing it with multiple users through source code management (TFS or VSS) will be shown. All the methods and approaches demonstrated are currently in use in a live environment. Attendees will learn mechanisms that allow them to create their own build process that will be repeatable and can be automated.

Event Date: 19-11-2008 16:00 - Category: Regular Session (60 minutes) - Track: Application Development
## Speaker(s): David Baldauff
## Title: Designing a Secure SQL Server 2008 Solution 
## Description:
### In Designing a Secure SQL Server 2008 Solution we will go into many practical concerns a DBA or developer has when securing SQL Server and designing a secure solution. We will cover how SQL Server Authentication is susceptible to hacking attempts, and how you can avoid SQL Server Authentication with the use of Windows Authentication and Kerberos. We will also cover how to improve security when SQL Server Authentication is desired by encrypting the connection using SSL. Further this presentation will go into some practical suggestions on how to improve application authentication design. This presentation will describe Kerberos at a high level, and then go into detail on how to setup Delegation and Kerberos authentication using SQL Server, IIS and a client. Additionally, we will delve into delegation across two SQL instances and a client. The presentation will include a review of the tools necessary to setup delegation and Kerberos and the debugging techniques used to resolve Kerberos authentication problems. If you are looking for a way to improve your security, eliminate the need for SQL authentication and understand the tools needed to do this, then this presentation is for you. If you know what a double-hop is and could never quite find a way around the problem before, then this presentation is for you. And, if you ever wondered how to get a client app authenticated through IIS to SQL server and maintain auditing, then this presentation is for you. On the side of improving application authentication, we will discuss how to best utilize application roles, database roles and Active Directory integration. We will demonstrate the use of a database role to authenticate Active Directory groups and how this method results in low security maintenance for DBAs, and instead keeps this activity in the network administration realm where possible. Furthermore, we will discuss how Application Roles can be used in conjunction with Database Roles to prevent other clients from accessing your database, while facilitating minimal maintenance on SQL Server logins and permissions. Generally, this presentation is intended to give you a detailed tour of authentication issues in SQL Server 2008.

## Speaker(s): Joe Yong
## Title: Upgrading to SQL Server 2008: Lessons learned and recommended practices 
## Description:
### w did you test your application before upgrading to SQL Server 2005 a few years back? Read the marketing glossies that said ""No major changes, it just works!"" so you ""plonked"" it in and hoped it worked? Did it? How about running Upgrade Advisor? Did you encounter problems after UA said there weren`t any? Ever heard of the Upgrade Assistant tool? Performing a major version upgrade can be a daunting task considering how many moving parts today`s applications typically have. Verifying that your application will work without problems is no small feat. Issues such as TSQL compatibility, system and user function, deprecated features, security models, etc... all contribute to making your testing efforts harder. This session will cover both tools and application compatibility testing methodology developed joint by Microsoft and Scalability Experts. Beyond just static analysis of your database, this session will also provide detailed guidance on how to test actual code execution against SQL Server 2008 including dynamic SQL for both in-place upgrade and side-by-side (migrate) methods.

## Title: Creating an SSIS, SSAS and SSRS monitoring solution with SSIS, SSAS and SSRS 
## Description:
### The Microsoft BI stack is now mainstream, and mission-critical implementations can be found in the largest businesses worldwide. However, the kind of monitoring tools that we take for granted with the relational engine simply don`t exist yet for Integration Services, Analysis Services and Reporting Services. How do we know if our Integration Services packages are taking longer and longer to run every day, who`s running that big query that`s slowing Analysis Services down, or if the boss ever looks at that Reporting Services report you took three weeks to create for him? Luckily the solution is close at hand: we can use SSIS, SSAS and SSRS to build an application for monitoring SSIS, SSAS and SSRS. This session will describe how you can do this.

## Title: SQL Server CLR 
## Description:
### The .NET CLR inside of SQL Server allows developers and DBA`s to utilize the power and flexibility of .NET languages (C#, VB.NET) from inside of the SQL Server Relational Engine. These managed languages provide untold opportunities for the developers and DBA`s to fully leverage the power of the data they have in their SQL Server to do things that TSQL was not designed or capable of doing. All of this without the need to pull the data out of the database and into the application tier. In this talk we will discuss and give examples of all the different types of objects (Stored Procedures, Triggers, Functions, and User Defined Types) you can build with the .NET CLR inside of SQL Server. We will also discuss the pros and cons of the CLR vs. TSQL. We will conclude with a discussion of the security model surrounding the .NET CLR in SQL Server.

## Title: Table Value Parameters Revolutionize Data Programming! 
## Description:
### Such an innocuous nameâ€”table value parametersâ€”for a radical new feature in SQL Server 2008! It`s the sort of thing that sounds like only a geek could love: pass a table to a procedure and/or get a table back. But it will change the way you think about programming SQL Server forever! If you`ve ever passed a comma or other delimited list of data values to a stored procedure, then split them up and processed them, or bumped up against the parameter limits, you know the pain that is now forever gone. In this session we`ll explore this new features, including the syntax and how to make use of it, both in SQL Server code as well as client code. You`ll leave the session wondering how you ever programmed without them!

## Speaker(s): Kalen Delaney
## Title: Guiding Your Query Plans 
## Description:
### Changing your production code to add query hints can be problematic for any number of reasons. You might be using a vendor application that doesn`t allow changes, or you might have a long approval process in your organization that must be strictly adhered to. And until (or unless) these hints can be added, your users will suffer the consequences of poorly performing queries. SQL Server 2005 introduced the ability to create Plan Guides which provide SQL Server`s execution engine with guidelines for processing your queries, without having to change the actual code. In this session we`ll look at the uses and best practicing for Plan Guides, and the details of how to set them up and how they work. We`ll also look at the enhancements to plan caching, query hints and Plan Guides in SQL Server 2008.

## Speaker(s): Hugo Kornelis
## Title: Cursors or setbased? Why not both? 
## Description:
### The ""cursor or setbased"" debate is a heated one. There are countless sites telling us that cursors are bad and setbased is best (except of course in for those situations where setbased is bad and cursors are best). With all this debate going on, it gets hard not to see this as an either or question. And that`s a shame, since some problems are best approached with a solution that uses a bit of both. In this session, Hugo will present some of those problems and demonstrate how the best performance can be achieved by thinking out of the box and implementing a solution that combines setbased and iterative characteristics.

## Speaker(s): Dan Bulos
## Title: Architecting a PerformancePoint Planning Solution 
## Description:
### Planning is a distinct and unique type of application. While planning shares some aspects with data warehousing and OLAP, it also has aspects of OLTP and therefore must be approached differently. Planning is more than just write-back, it is the system of record for the plan and as such requires workflow and process control. There are many different types of planning applications including financial, manufacturing, or entering targets for a corporate scorecard. This session will cover the how to analyze the application subject to determine an appropriate architecture that correctly uses the features of PPS in an effective and efficient manner. Can you have too many models? Or too few? What is the best use of subsites? Can vanilla PPS handle the application or must you go outside the box?

## Title: Monitoring Object Changes with Event Notification 
## Description:
### Have you ever want to know every change to every database or schema on your server? Do tables or procedures appear or, worse still disappear and you ask ""Who did that?"" Even if you have total control of your server, would you just like a nice log of when you made changes to objects for later attestation or auditing? Would you just like to get more horsed up on Service Broker and Event Notifications? If so, then you need to come to ""Monitoring Object Changes with Event Notification"". We will present a real-world solution that uses SQL Server 2005`s Service Broker and Event Notification technology to constantly monitor your servers for object changes - deletes, adds, and modifications. We`ll simplify for you exactly how the Service Broker technology works, how Event Notification ride on top of Service Broker, and how to leverage the techology. We`ll present an ideal blend of theory and demonstration with real world scripts to leave you with an solution that you can immediately use on your servers. Time permitting, we`ll do a brief review of SQL Database Mail since a key point of our solution is in the concept of messaging you with object changes. We`ll also point out how you might use the Event Notification technology for other purposes besides recording object changes.

## Speaker(s): James Luetkehoelter
## Title: What`s the Fuss? Collecting and Analyzing Performance Metrics in SQL Server 2005 and 2008 
## Description:
### In any discussion that revolves around SQL Server, DBAs and developers alike are invariably drawn towards a single core topic: that of performance tuning. And while performance is a key factor influencing success or failure of a database project, it is also a complex area. Fully tuning a system requires interrogation of metrics at the hardware, database, and application layers, plus external factors including networks and shared I/O systems. SQL Server exposes dozens of performance counters, DMVs, and DBCC commands that expose most--if not all--of the information you need to tune your system, but looking at the list can be a dizzying experience if you don`t have a roadmap to guide you. In this session we will cover the most important sources of performance data and discuss the best ways to collect and analyze the information in order to determine what performance issues you may have, and to help you track down (and eliminate) the culprits. We will focus on techniques designed to help you be proactive rather than reactive, and find performance problems before your users start knocking down your door. If you`ve ever received a call at 4:59 p.m. from an unhappy executive wondering why his report is taking so long to run, this session is for you.

## Description:
### This session will describe the Pan-STARRS architecture for designing a very large, 100TB+, scientific database implemented with SQL Server 2008. While the primary goal of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, Pan-STARRS, is to detect and characterize near-Earth objects that might threaten our planet, the collected data will contain relevant information for other interesting scientific projects such as the discovery of extra-solar planets, supernovae and Universe evolution, among many others. After telescope images are processed, catalogs with hundreds of billions of individual detections are generated. These astronomical numbers pose a special architectural challenge not only to load, organize, and query the database but also regarding fault-tolerance and recovery. The session will focus on how Pan-STARRS is taking advantage of key SQL Server 2008 features that make this challenge feasible.

## Title: SQL Server User-Defined Functions - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly 
## Description:
### User-defined functions are a nice feature for improving code reuse and lowering code maintenance burden. But what most developers do not know, they come with a cost. During this session we will look at different types of functions: scalar-valued and table-valued, both in T-SQL as well as SQLCLR, and their behavior and performance impact. We will go through real-life examples of how, why and when use of functions in your queries can backfire and cause performance problems. We will also establish some best practices for use of UDFs, based on the lessons learned.

## Description:
### The introduction of the native XML datatype in SQL Server opened up many possibilities for how we manage the data in our databases. It also struck terror in the hearts of some DBAs. When does it make sense to store data as XML in a SQL Server database? What are the potential problems with doing so? This session will analyze a real-life example of a project that was successfully implemented using the XML datatype as the foundation of the database design. This project was executed on a database that was already in production and had millions of users whose data needed to be preserved. The session will examine the database design and explore details of the implementation, including XML schema validation and utilization of XML data type methods. It will explain how collaboration between the DBA and application developers was crucial to the project`s success. The complex process of converting millions of relational rows into XML documents will be reviewed. Finally, the session will describe how the inclusion of XML actually reduced the size and improved the performance and maintenance of a busy production database.

## Speaker(s): 
## Title: Optimizing bulk operations involving data cleansing and merging with Table-Valued Parameters 
## Description:
### SqlBulkCopy provides the fastest way to insert data in bulk, but when the data must be processed on the server prior to insertion application have had to resort to traditional APIs using row-by-row logic on the client side which have much lower performance. Table-valued parameters have row-streaming capabilities similar to SqlBulkCopy but with the added capability of processing the data on the server before rows are persisted in the database. Two common scenarios that will benefit from this feature are data transformation and merging. We will walk through a solution based on SQL Server 2005, and then look at a solution based on TVPs and compare.

## Speaker(s): Ross LoForte
## Title: Applying Workload Resource Governance with SQL Server 2008 
## Description:
### A major trend is that current hardware is getting more powerful and able to support a greater number of applications on the same database server. As a result, there is a great deal of interest around SQL Server consolidation. After consolidation, how do you prevent one application from using more database workload resources while starving another? To solve this problem, the Microsoft platform has strategies with Windows Resource Manager, Hyper-V Virtualization, SQL Server 2008 resource governor and other SQL Server resource governances. This including workload governance in multiple SQL Server instances, data mirroring and failover cluster implementations. This session first describes the concept, advantages and disadvantages of each technology and then provides real-life examples with best practices applying each of these technologies by themselves and in combinations to solve the resource governance situations.

## Speaker(s): Craig Utley
## Title: Avoid Slow SSAS Queries: MDX Query Troubleshooting 
## Description:
### Do you have SSAS queries that you feel should be faster? Multidimensional Expressions, or MDX, is the language used to work with Analysis Services. Similar to SQL for the relational engine, MDX is a language for queries and DDL statements on multidimensional cubes in Analysis Services. Troubleshooting slow MDX queries is often challenging because the level of support provided by the tools and the Analysis Services engine is not as mature as that found in the relational engine. This session covers the methods for examining slow queries using the SQL Profiler and Performance Monitor to determine the need for aggregations, caching problems, memory constraints, and so forth. Best practices for optimizing MDX will be examined, and various server properties will be discussed as necessary to help correct query issues. Attendees will leave armed with a practical approach to locating bottlenecks and strategies for speeding up queries.

## Title: Advanced Policy-Based Management with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 
## Description:
### Over the past few years, the role of database servers has dramatically increased its importance in almost every industry. Meanwhile, SQL Server has increased its feature set and its ability to scale in enterprise environments. As a result, the management of database servers has become a complex, manual and brittle process, with limited insight for troubleshooting problems. Aiming at improving, SQL Server manageability, as part of an ongoing effort by Microsoft to reduce the total cost of ownership, SQL Server 2008 introduces Policy-Based Management. Policy-Based Management enables users to manage SQL Servers by declarative intent, a.k.a., policies, that is, by specifying how the system should be and not the means to achieve it. By raising the level of management abstraction, Policy-Based Management simplifies the management process, provides policy automation, and provides greater insight into the system. This session focuses on the advanced features including: advanced condition building, target filtering, policy alert notification, and PowerShell integration.

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: Why Normalization Matters 
## Description:
### In this session I will give an overview of the common normal forms and show why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming ""difficulties"" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can`t use an index efficiently). Properly structured data structures make it easier to work with data in simple SQL statements rather than having to resort to functional programming and cursors.
