## Speaker(s): Shabnam Watson
## Title: Aggregations in Power BI
## Description:
### Aggregations are now generally available in Power BI and are one of the most important optimization methods for managing large datasets. Combined with Direct Query storage mode, they allow big datasets to be analyzed efficiently by answering high level analytical queries quickly from memory while sending more detailed queries back to the source database.

In this session, you will learn about aggregations, different table storage modes, how to set up aggregation tables and configure them to improve query performance.

# The New ML Lifecycle: Deploying and Managing Machine Learning Models at Scale

Event Date: 22-08-2019 19:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Diego Oppenheimer, Cormac Foster
## Title: The New ML Lifecycle: Deploying and Managing Machine Learning Models at Scale
## Description:
### Over decades, app developers have refined a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with established roles, responsibilities and tools. Unfortunately, the traditional SDLC doesn’t map well to Machine Learning (ML), leaving Data Science teams to sort out manual solutions. The Result? Data Scientists spend the majority of their time doing everything except data science, and many ML projects never get off the ground.

This Webinar will help you understand how can we adapt our infrastructure, operations, staffing, and training to meet the challenges of a newSDLC for ML–without throwing away everything that already works.

Topics will include:

•	How model and application development are different
•	Where the traditional SDLC breaks down for ML
•	How leading companies have automated model deployment and management 
•	How to integrate with existing life cycle management tools
•	How to deploy, serve, and govern ML models at scale

## Speaker(s): Dinesh Priyankara
## Title: Stepping into Data Science: Predictive Analytics
## Description:
### Predictive Analytics is no longer an occasional implementation, it has become a must-to-have feature for any industry. However, the way of getting data prepared for experiments and make necessary adjustments in data science angle is still unknown to many and not practicing well. Let’s discuss the process, few areas related to data engineering, how to create a training experiment and convert it into a predictive experiment using Python and Jupiter notebook.

Key Learning
•         What is Data Science and its processes?
•         Feature engineering and preparing data for an experiment
•         Make a training experiment and predictive experiment using Python
