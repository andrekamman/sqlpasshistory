## Title: Scaling SQL Server 2012
## Description:
### SQL Server implementations can rapidly evolve and become more complex, forcing DBAs and developers to think about how they can scale their solution quickly and effectively. Scaling up is relatively easy but can be expensive, while scaling out requires significant engineering time and effort. If you suggest hardware upgrades, you may be accused of simply “throwing hardware at the problem.” And if you try to scale out, you may be thwarted by a lack of development resources or third-party software restrictions. As your database server nears its load capacity, what can you do?

This comprehensive full-day session will give you concrete, practical advice about how to scale SQL Server. Starting with your current workload, configuration, and hardware, we’ll explore how to find and alleviate bottlenecks, whether they are workload related, configuration related, or hardware related. Next, we’ll cover how you can decide whether you should scale up or scale out your data tier. For scale-up solutions, you’ll learn how to scale up properly with nearly zero down time. And for scale-out implementations, you’ll learn about practical, production-ready techniques such as vertical partitioning, horizontal partitioning, and data-dependent routing. We’ll also cover how to use middle-tier caching and other application techniques to increase your overall scalability.

## Speaker(s): Paul White
## Title: Understanding the Optimizer and Interpreting Execution Plans
## Description:
### Expert-level query tuning and performance analysis requires a deep understanding of both the query optimizer and the execution plans it produces.

The first part of this full-day session will cover the SQL Server query optimizer in-depth. Starting with a clear overview of the basics, the session will progress rapidly to look at the detailed and often subtle behaviors that have real impact on almost every query you write. At the end of the optimizer section, you will understand how it works, its strengths and weaknesses, and how to design databases and write queries to get the best from it.

The second part of the session will begin with an introduction to the Execution Engine framework, query plan operators, and the main things to check in execution plans. We’ll then move on to developing the expert practical skills you’ll need to start interpreting execution plans instead of just reading them, including accurate plan assessment, selecting targets for improvement, and confidently making effective changes.

## Speaker(s): Itzik Ben-Gan
## Title: Practical T-SQL – Efficient Solutions
## Description:
### Come join this full-day session and learn more about the practical use of T-SQL to address common tasks efficiently. Some solutions for these tasks don’t get optimized efficiently, and achieving efficient solutions can require a lot of creativity. This session will walk you through such examples, explain the reasons for the inefficiencies, and then provide optimized solutions using powerful tools in the language, such as window functions, APPLY, MERGE, OFFSET-FETCH, sequences, and more.

We’ll cover topics such as temporal data, with efficient handling of temporal intervals; new solutions to gaps and islands problems; statistical calculations such as median; aggregates against partitioned tables; complexities of generating surrogate keys; and copying data with dependencies. We’ll also look at suggestions for improvements in SQL Server.

## Speaker(s): Devin Knight, Brian Knight
## Title: Growing Up with SSAS: From PowerPivot to MOLAP Cubes
## Description:
### Come learn how to grow a cube from a very basic PowerPivot Excel spreadsheet designed by a business analyst through the life cycle to a full SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) MOLAP cube. This demo-intensive, full-day session will kick off with a scenario of a business analyst trying to get data from a variety of data sources without a data warehouse. You’ll see how to solve this problem and deliver self-service reporting with PowerPivot in Excel 2013.

You’ll follow the scenario over time as this single report needs to be viewed by dozens in the department and must be upsized to SharePoint. Then as months pass and the CEO wants to secure the report and scale it better, you'll learn how to scale the isolated reports into SSAS's tabular model, which offers better security and flexibility. Over time, the cube becomes so important that the CIO wants to merge it with the data warehouse and scale it even better. In this last part of the session, you'll learn how to create a traditional cube using SSAS's MOLAP model to increase scalability and processing power.
 
Bring your laptop to this session so you can work through each of the examples, and you’ll have a complete set of solutions by the end of the day.

## Speaker(s): Denny Cherry
## Title: Storage and Virtualization for DBAs
## Description:
### Come spend the day focusing on two of the biggest topics in the DBA field: how to properly design your SAN storage solution, and how to properly design your virtualization solution.

The first half of this pre-conference session will focus on the storage array. Storage can be one of the biggest bottlenecks when it comes to database performance. It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language. In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives and digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, and the storage configuration.

In the second half of the day, we'll cover the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment. We’ll look at when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not. As with most things in the database world, there are no hard-set, one-size-fits-all answers about virtualization. But there are times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea – and can save you money.

## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: How to Design a Relational Database
## Description:
### Database design is a seemingly natural process, lending everyone to try to do it themselves, from an administrative assistant with a spreadsheet to a C# programmer with a copy of SQL Server Express. Unfortunately, the finer points of excellent database design are not intuitively obvious, and the difference between building a spreadsheet and a solid enterprise database is like the difference between building a doghouse and a two-story house, or even the Empire State Building.

To design a database correctly, there are several things you need to understand, including the basics of relational theory, how to gather and apply requirements, normalization, etc. While having a good foundation in the fundamentals is more than many database designers have, it is only the start.

In this full-day pre-conference session, we’ll cover relational database design in three sections. First, we’ll begin with a discussion and demonstration of database design principles; second, we’ll move into a classroom database design section, where we’ll take a scenario and produce a database; and third, we’ll break up into teams and design databases that we’ll then discuss as a class.

## Title: Visualizing John Snow's Cholera Map Using Microsoft BI
## Description:
### Back in 1854, London was developing into one of the world's first modern cities, although without the essential sanitary infrastructures. This along with the increase in population made it the perfect breeding ground for many diseases, such as cholera. Around the same time, physician John Snow explored the correlation between diseases and contaminated water supplies and came up with one of the most famous maps in history. Relive the adventure of John Snow as we follow his journey in this session using Microsoft BI tools. As we recreate his map, we’ll also talk about the  steps and best practices for exploring geospatial data.

## Speaker(s): Mindy Curnutt
## Title: Exposing a Chatty Cathy: What a Drag!
## Description:
### Finding long-running, resource-consuming queries is relatively easy nowadays. SQL Profiler, Extended Events, DMVs, and plenty of third-party tools bubble these right to the top of their list for easy picking. What’s much harder to pinpoint is application behavior that puts pressure on the database through thousands (or millions) of tiny, very quickly running (and non-parameterized) statements – think "death by a thousand paper cuts.”
   
This session will demonstrate the following:
• How to cast a net to catch a "Chatty Cathy" application in action
• How to expose and aggregate every round trip to SQL Server from the application process being reviewed (without bringing the server to its knees)
• How to identify when indexes, purging, more hardware, and other SQL Server-side "improvements" will not solve a performance bottleneck
• The importance the application's approach to SQL Server plays when it comes to load, latency, and user experience

## Title: Building Your T-SQL Tool Kit: Window Function Fundamentals
## Description:
### Have you pulled a script to identify duplicates from a blog post but couldn’t quite get it to work because you weren’t sure what that ROW_NUMBER() function was doing? Maybe you heard talk about creating running totals without using subqueries, but you got frustrated when the groups weren’t totaling correctly. Or maybe, you’ve never even heard of window functions.

All are good reasons to attend this all-demo session, which demystifies this versatile T-SQL tool. First, we’ll break apart the OVER clause, the key to understanding how window functions work. Then we’ll expand on each group of functions that can use the OVER clause: ranking, aggregate, and analytic functions. Finally, we’ll look at real scenarios where this tool works and talk about performance considerations.

When you leave, you’ll have the fundamentals you need to fully develop your mastery of window functions.

### Windows Azure SQL Database is a fully-managed, scalable service based on SQL Server technology. Yet “fully-managed” does not necessarily mean that many or all of the tasks and responsibilities of the DBA are managed and executed by Microsoft or the service itself. The DBA is crucial in Windows Azure SQL Database, and this session will look at the all-important role of the DBA when working with SQL Database. We’ll discuss how many of the on-premise functions, tasks, and responsibilities of the DBA are accomplished in a cloud environment, specifically SQL Database. We’ll also cover the tips, tricks, and best practices a DBA should know for accomplishing familiar on-premise tasks in the cloud.

Well, you've deployed only the client side of Power View: Excel. Now you need to deploy the server side: SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) in SharePoint-integrated mode. In this session, you'll learn about that architecture and what you need to license and deploy it. You'll see how to configure a SharePoint 2013 farm and integrate SSRS to get Power View sheets in Excel Services, standalone Power View reports, and classic SSRS reports all up and running.

## Title: Master the Date Dimension Like a Time Lord
## Description:
### All data warehouses need a Date dimension to enable analysis by date. Most DW designers will just use a default one provided by the tools, but what if you need to set up custom holidays or want different calendars, such as Fiscal or Julian? You can have any Date dimension you want by using a single SQL script that can be modified and rerun as necessary to update the dimension. By the end of this session, you’ll be a Time Lord in your own company!

## Speaker(s): Arie Jones
## Title: Keeping an Eye on Your Data with Change Data Capture 
## Description:
### Most modern enterprise database environments require some measure of auditing for their data.

## Speaker(s): Allen White
## Title: Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell
## Description:
### Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination. Creating the individual packages can be tedious, and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and over again. BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy. In this session, we'll see how you can use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.

## Title: DANGER! The Art and Science of Presenting
## Description:
### Is there a significant difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: No.

The past decade, we’ve learned a lot about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The idea of Emotional Intelligence – EQ – is a compelling concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading others. Although EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, this session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can use it to make your presentations better in the following areas:
•	Crafting better slide decks
•	Preparing yourself for presenting
•	Delivering your content
•	Dealing with the unexpected

Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room – including you.

## Description:
### The opportunity to lead can be thrust upon us at any time, and how we react will be the difference in our team’s success. The core of leadership is not the position but the “act” of leading and is too important, too individual, and too complex to neatly reverse-engineer into three or five simple rules or an acronym. Drawing on the speaker’s career experiences from DBA to company Vice President and PASS Board member, this session will explore leadership and key aspects to leading successfully. If you are already a manager, planning to lead a team, or just want to be prepared when given the opportunity to lead, this session will provide perspective on enablers to leadership success. Be prepared to have your thoughts on leadership challenged and to share your questions, personal views, and opinions. Interaction is a key part of this unique presentation.

## Title: Policy-Based Management and Central Management Server
## Description:
### Who doesn't want to save time and simplify their database administration? So if you aren't taking advantage of Policy-Based Management (PBM) and Central Management Server (CMS), it's time to take a look at these two  under-utilized features of SQL Server.

PBM lets you administer and control your SQL Server environment in a way that was very difficult or even impossible before. Simply put, PBM lets you define rules or policies to govern your SQL Server enterprise. You can enforce naming conventions, prevent certain object creations, get notifications if a rule you defined is broken, and much more. CMS lets you organize and manage your instances using predefined groups from a single common point. Have you ever wanted to run a code block against multiple instances at the same time? CMS lets you easily do this and more. See how these two features can add a whole new level of manageability to your environment and reduce the time you spend achieving your management goals.

## Title: Whatcha Doin'? Passive Security for Hostile Environments
## Description:
### Ideal database security settings may exist in books, but rarely in reality. Is your CIO a member of the sysadmin role because they demanded it? Or maybe some users have rights for purely political reasons? Just because you can't enforce security through typical means doesn't mean you're powerless.

Attend this session to learn about the SQL Server features that allow you to keep track of what your users are up to at all times and sleep a little easier. Through various scenarios and demos, you’ll see how technologies such as event notifications, auditing, and extended events can help ensure nothing happens on your system without you knowing about it. Even in optimally secured environments, these techniques can come in handy. The best security is often that which cannot be seen.

And what is the best way to get rid of it? Come find out from the person who wrote the tools for detecting and removing index fragmentation.

In this session, you’ll learn how fragmentation occurs and why the process that leads to it can often be as damaging to performance as the fragmentation itself. You'll also learn how to test for fragmentation, the different methods of removing it, and everything you need to consider when putting together an appropriate fragmentation-management strategy.

### The Microsoft Commerce Platform supports business-to-customer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) scenarios for Microsoft products such as adCenter, Xbox Live, and the Windows Phone Store. Supporting payments using 13 payment methods spanning 84 currencies across 111 localized markets, the Commerce Platform handled over 51.1 million active Microsoft customers in FY2012. Needless to say, uptime of the Commerce Platform infrastructure is critical, with most services having very tight SLAs that need to be actively monitored.

In this session, we’ll show how we moved from a database-centric approach to a heterogeneous, event-driven architecture that is helping the Commerce Platform understand what is happening, what happened, and in the near future, what should happen. We’ll discuss how, in addition to using SQL Databases, our use of the Reactive Framework and the HDInsight Service helps fulfill the various requirements of the overall system-insight solution.

## Title: Mouth Wide Shut: Interviews from the Other Side of the Table
## Description:
### You’re a DBA, and it’s finally your turn to conduct an interview. As it turns out, asking the questions is nearly as hard as answering them! And listen to those answers: This guy has “master” and “expert” all over his resume, but he sounds like a mid-level the more he talks – and will likely turn out to be a junior once hired.

In this interactive session, we’ll show you the most effective ways to find out what the candidate really knows. You’ll learn about effective tech screening, drawing answers out of nervous candidates, and how to use probing questions to really determine the applicant’s true expertise. 

Join this session to learn:
• How to pick up on resume “inaccuracies”
• How to truly vet a candidate’s skills
• Why keeping your mouth shut is a vital interviewing skill
• The one thing that interviewers never do (and should)
