## Speaker(s): Glenn Berry
## Title: Scaling SQL Server 2012
## Description:
### SQL Server implementations can rapidly evolve and become more complex, forcing DBAs and developers to think about how they can scale their solution quickly and effectively. Scaling up is relatively easy but can be expensive, while scaling out requires significant engineering time and effort. If you suggest hardware upgrades, you may be accused of simply “throwing hardware at the problem.” And if you try to scale out, you may be thwarted by a lack of development resources or third-party software restrictions. As your database server nears its load capacity, what can you do?

This comprehensive full-day session will give you concrete, practical advice about how to scale SQL Server. Starting with your current workload, configuration, and hardware, we’ll explore how to find and alleviate bottlenecks, whether they are workload related, configuration related, or hardware related. Next, we’ll cover how you can decide whether you should scale up or scale out your data tier. For scale-up solutions, you’ll learn how to scale up properly with nearly zero down time. And for scale-out implementations, you’ll learn about practical, production-ready techniques such as vertical partitioning, horizontal partitioning, and data-dependent routing. We’ll also cover how to use middle-tier caching and other application techniques to increase your overall scalability.

Event Date: 14-10-2013 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Paul White
## Title: Understanding the Optimizer and Interpreting Execution Plans
## Description:
### Expert-level query tuning and performance analysis requires a deep understanding of both the query optimizer and the execution plans it produces.

The first part of this full-day session will cover the SQL Server query optimizer in-depth. Starting with a clear overview of the basics, the session will progress rapidly to look at the detailed and often subtle behaviors that have real impact on almost every query you write. At the end of the optimizer section, you will understand how it works, its strengths and weaknesses, and how to design databases and write queries to get the best from it.

The second part of the session will begin with an introduction to the Execution Engine framework, query plan operators, and the main things to check in execution plans. We’ll then move on to developing the expert practical skills you’ll need to start interpreting execution plans instead of just reading them, including accurate plan assessment, selecting targets for improvement, and confidently making effective changes.

## Speaker(s): Devin Knight, Brian Knight
## Title: Growing Up with SSAS: From PowerPivot to MOLAP Cubes
## Description:
### Come learn how to grow a cube from a very basic PowerPivot Excel spreadsheet designed by a business analyst through the life cycle to a full SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) MOLAP cube. This demo-intensive, full-day session will kick off with a scenario of a business analyst trying to get data from a variety of data sources without a data warehouse. You’ll see how to solve this problem and deliver self-service reporting with PowerPivot in Excel 2013.

You’ll follow the scenario over time as this single report needs to be viewed by dozens in the department and must be upsized to SharePoint. Then as months pass and the CEO wants to secure the report and scale it better, you'll learn how to scale the isolated reports into SSAS's tabular model, which offers better security and flexibility. Over time, the cube becomes so important that the CIO wants to merge it with the data warehouse and scale it even better. In this last part of the session, you'll learn how to create a traditional cube using SSAS's MOLAP model to increase scalability and processing power.
 
Bring your laptop to this session so you can work through each of the examples, and you’ll have a complete set of solutions by the end of the day.

## Speaker(s): Denny Cherry
## Title: Storage and Virtualization for DBAs
## Description:
### Come spend the day focusing on two of the biggest topics in the DBA field: how to properly design your SAN storage solution, and how to properly design your virtualization solution.

The first half of this pre-conference session will focus on the storage array. Storage can be one of the biggest bottlenecks when it comes to database performance. It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language. In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives and digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, and the storage configuration.

In the second half of the day, we'll cover the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment. We’ll look at when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not. As with most things in the database world, there are no hard-set, one-size-fits-all answers about virtualization. But there are times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea – and can save you money.

Event Date: 15-10-2013 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Enterprise Database Administration & Deployment
## Speaker(s): Allan Hirt
## Title: Plan and Deploy Successful Clustered Solutions for SQL Server
## Description:
### With the introduction of SQL Server 2012, two major availability features – failover clustered instances (FCIs) and availability groups (AGs) – require an underlying Windows Server failover cluster (WSFC). It is more important than ever to have a solid clustered deployment under SQL Server. Because FCIs and AGs work differently, there are some subtle and some not-so-subtle differences you need to be aware of. And since most DBAs are rarely involved in the planning and deployment of the WSFC, getting the right solution in place is essential. What you don’t know can reduce your availability, despite the fact you are on an architecture that is supposed to keep you up more than down.

This full-day pre-conference session will cover how to plan, deploy, and administer clustered SQL Server solutions. The session will feature live examples and demos and cover topics such as quorum, disk configuration, networking (local and between sites), patching of both SQL Server and Windows, and configuring test clusters in virtual machines. The session will also highlight differences between versions of SQL Server or Windows that may affect your deployment and will touch on using the cloud, known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Take advantage of this opportunity to learn what you need to know about this important configuration aspect that affects most DBAs, whether your SQL Server deployments are physical or virtual.

# How to Design a Relational Database
#### [Back to calendar](#id-25)
Event Date: 15-10-2013 08:30 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: How to Design a Relational Database
## Description:
### Database design is a seemingly natural process, lending everyone to try to do it themselves, from an administrative assistant with a spreadsheet to a C# programmer with a copy of SQL Server Express. Unfortunately, the finer points of excellent database design are not intuitively obvious, and the difference between building a spreadsheet and a solid enterprise database is like the difference between building a doghouse and a two-story house, or even the Empire State Building.

To design a database correctly, there are several things you need to understand, including the basics of relational theory, how to gather and apply requirements, normalization, etc. While having a good foundation in the fundamentals is more than many database designers have, it is only the start.

In this full-day pre-conference session, we’ll cover relational database design in three sections. First, we’ll begin with a discussion and demonstration of database design principles; second, we’ll move into a classroom database design section, where we’ll take a scenario and produce a database; and third, we’ll break up into teams and design databases that we’ll then discuss as a class.

## Speaker(s): Michael Antonovich
## Title: Putting Quality Back in Your Data Analysis
## Description:
### One of the challenges in developing business intelligence solutions is ensuring that the data doesn’t have inconsistencies, incomplete records, invalid or inaccurate values, or data duplication. Sometimes when consolidating data from multiple sources, you have to transform data to create one standard set of domain values in a standard format. SQL Server 2012 answers these needs with Data Quality Services (DQS).

In this session, you’ll learn the basics of what DQS is and how you can use it to clean your data. You’ll see how to build a domain, both manually and from an existing data table. You’ll then see how to use these domains to validate tables in SQL Server and Excel, preparing them for use in SQL Server Analysis Services and PowerPivot. After this session, you’ll understand how by putting quality back into your data, you can be your organization's BI hero.

## Speaker(s): Mindy Curnutt
## Title: Exposing a Chatty Cathy: What a Drag!
## Description:
### Finding long-running, resource-consuming queries is relatively easy nowadays. SQL Profiler, Extended Events, DMVs, and plenty of third-party tools bubble these right to the top of their list for easy picking. What’s much harder to pinpoint is application behavior that puts pressure on the database through thousands (or millions) of tiny, very quickly running (and non-parameterized) statements – think "death by a thousand paper cuts.”
   
This session will demonstrate the following:
• How to cast a net to catch a "Chatty Cathy" application in action
• How to expose and aggregate every round trip to SQL Server from the application process being reviewed (without bringing the server to its knees)
• How to identify when indexes, purging, more hardware, and other SQL Server-side "improvements" will not solve a performance bottleneck
• The importance the application's approach to SQL Server plays when it comes to load, latency, and user experience

## Title: Inside SQL Server 2012 Memory: The Sequel
## Description:
### This half-day sequel to the popular “Debugging the Memory of SQL Server 2008” session from a few years ago goes deep into the architecture, implementation, and “how it works” of SQL Server 2012 database engine memory management. To get the most out of this 500+-level session, you should have a fundamental working knowledge of the SQL Server database engine. You would also benefit from reading up on some Windows memory fundamentals before the session (hint: “Windows Internals, 6th Edition” and MSDN’s Memory Management primer (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366779) are good resources).

Want demos? There will be plenty – and the Windows Debugger will definitely make an appearance. You’ll walk away from this session armed with deep technical details and practical knowledge that can help you better deploy, manage, and maintain your SQL Server environment.

## Title: Congratulations, You're Now a DBA...
## Description:
### You were just anointed DBA by the head of development because you knew how to create a database and add some tables, or maybe because you were the network engineer who installed SQL Server and added SQL logins. Now what do you do? And how do you keep your company’s data protected and the SQL Servers up and running?

This session will give you a road map for succeeding as a DBA. We’ll cover all of the basics that a typical DBA needs to know and focus on Day 1 and Year 1. By the end of the session, you’ll know what is important, what should be on your daily task list, and what you can ignore.

## Speaker(s): Stacia Varga
## Title: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Automating Your BI Framework 
## Description:
### Quite frankly, some aspects of building out a business intelligence solution are tedious. As you cycle through iterations of your star schema, you’ll find that even a simple data type change in the data warehouse requires you to make corresponding changes to staging tables, SSIS packages, and SSAS multidimensional or tabular models that take a considerable amount of time to implement. But there’s a better, faster way! 

In this session, we’ll explore lessons from a project that required implementation of a framework to easily generate BI objects based on reusable patterns. We’ll walk through the decision points in the framework design, review the implementation steps, and see demonstrations of how easily you can make iterative changes to your BI solution’s design by using reusable design patterns. Whether you simply want to accelerate change management or reproduce objects in bulk on demand, this session will give you practical tips for automating these processes.

## Speaker(s): Joseph D'Antoni
## Title: Accelerate Database Performance Through Data Compression
## Description:
### Much like the cars of the 1970s sacrificed gas mileage for better performance, database technology has also made its share of sacrifices for efficiency. Fortunately, times have changed significantly since then. Just as adding a turbocharger to a car delivers more power while saving fuel, the addition of compression to a database accelerates read performance while saving disk space.

Come learn how, why, and when compression is the solution to your database performance problems. This session will discuss the basics of how compression and deduplication reduce your data volume. We’ll review the three different types of compression in SQL Server 2012, including the overhead and benefits of each and the situations for which each is appropriate, and examine the special type of compression used for ColumnStore indexes to help your data warehouse queries fly. As with turbo, data compression also has drawbacks, which we’ll cover as well.

# How to Model and Implement a Hierarchy in SQL Server
#### [Back to calendar](#id-25)
Event Date: 16-10-2013 16:45 - Category: Spotlight Session (90 minutes) - Track: Application & Database Development
## Speaker(s): Louis Davidson
## Title: How to Model and Implement a Hierarchy in SQL Server
## Description:
### One of the most common structures you will come across in the real world is a hierarchy (either a single parent "tree" or a multi-parent "graph"). Many systems will implement the obvious examples, such as a corporate managerial structure or a bill of materials. It turns out that almost any many-to-many relationship can be used as a hierarchy to find the relationship of parent rows to child rows (for example, the relationship of actors to movies they’ve been in).

In this session, we’ll discuss how to represent a hierarchy in your data model, and then walk through several different implementations of hierarchies that you can use to optimize your hierarchy implementations and put into practice immediately, with ready-made T-SQL examples.

## Speaker(s): Grant Fritchey
## Title: Query Performance Tuning for Azure SQL Database
## Description:
### Just because you're using an Azure SQL Database doesn't mean you can avoid tuning queries. Microsoft has throttling in place that could seriously impact your systems if your queries are using lots of resources. Data movement out of the Azure storage costs money. Federating databases means queries run on multiple systems all at the same time.

This session will introduce you to the tools available for identifying poor performing queries, including dynamic management objects, query I/O, and others. You'll learn how to understand why a query is running slow using the Azure Database Portal. With this understanding, you’ll be able to fix your poorly performing queries. All in the cloud.

## Speaker(s): Kimberly Tripp
## Title: Skewed Data, Poor Cardinality Estimates, and Plans Gone Bad
## Description:
### When data distribution is heavily skewed, cardinality estimation (how many rows the query optimizer expects each operator to process) can be wildly incorrect, resulting in poor quality query plans and degraded performance. You've probably seen the advice to update all statistics if a query plan looks wrong – but is that the right advice?

In many cases, no! These are "sledgehammer" approaches, and while they might solve some problems (usually parameter sniffing problems), they don’t solve the actual problem. In this session, you'll learn a generalized yet tailored-to-the-table way to solve query plan quality problems for very large tables (VLTs). Topics will include creating, using, and updating filtered statistics; using forced parameterization and templatized plan guides; and understanding stored procedures and how they can leverage filtered statistics.

## Speaker(s): Luke Jian
## Title: Anatomy of a Join
## Description:
### A good understanding of join algorithms is essential in diagnosing and fixing issues related to bad query plans. However, one of today’s realities is that a lot of database professionals do not have a computer science degree and didn’t sit through a formal “Introduction to Relational Databases” course. This session seeks to fill in some of the gaps that might exist by looking in-depth at the three types of join operations.

We’ll visualize how the join operations’ algorithms work so you can understand how query plans are computed, and then we’ll look at why these join operations have very different performance characteristics and why the optimizer chooses a specific join operator to use in a query plan. You’ll see through demonstrations that empirical cost calculations are similar to what the query optimizer actually returns.

## Speaker(s): Thomas LeBlanc
## Title: Slicing and Dicing: Attributes and Hierarchies in SSAS 2012
## Description:
### Attributes are the gateway to measures (facts), and using hierarchies can ease the path and improve performance. As BI developers, we sometimes want to give everything to business users rather than concentrating on the requirements. But the configuration of these slicers and dicers are very important in Analysis Services multidimensional cubes.

Attributes and attribute hierarchies have many properties that can be confusing at times. What is the difference between Visible and Not Enabled? Should I make the attribute not visible if it is in a hierarchy? Where can I group related attributes together so it is not confusing to the end user? What if there are too many distinct values for an attribute – can I group some values? How can I improve the performance of a cube? What about Slowly Changing Dimension data? Where is a many-to-many configured?

This demo-rich session will cover 80% to 90% of the available properties, with practical examples to take back to the office.

## Speaker(s): Paul Randal
## Title: Waits, Latches, and Spinlocks: Internals and Analysis
## Description:
### One of the first things you should check when investigating performance issues is wait statistics, which can often point you in the right direction for further analysis. Unfortunately, many people misinterpret what SQL Server is telling them and jump to conclusions about how to solve the problem, resulting in “knee-jerk performance tuning.” Below waits are layers of synchronization complexity, called latches and spinlocks. In this deep and detailed session, you’ll learn what waits, latches, and spinlocks are; how to analyze them; and potential solutions to common problem patterns.

## Speaker(s): Dan Bulos
## Title: Dashboard Design Best Practices
## Description:
### How can you design an effective, useful, and appealing dashboard? Many articles and books focus on the mechanics of how to choose KPIs and the various formats available for displaying data. But even the most significant information can be lost if it’s not displayed in a memorable way. Is the right format for critical values a grid, a graph, a gauge, maps, diagrams, or something else? What kinds of information are best displayed in a line vs. a bar graph? Where does a scorecard fit into all this?

Because they aren’t static, how dashboards interact and how they fit into a larger reporting environment offer a particular design challenge. Designing the navigation across the content on each dashboard page is critical to communicating the desired message. Join this session to review best-practices techniques for displaying a set of data in a dashboard for maximum impact and explore a framework for constructing dashboards from the various content types.

## Title: Policy-Based Management and Central Management Server
## Description:
### Who doesn't want to save time and simplify their database administration? So if you aren't taking advantage of Policy-Based Management (PBM) and Central Management Server (CMS), it's time to take a look at these two  under-utilized features of SQL Server.

PBM lets you administer and control your SQL Server environment in a way that was very difficult or even impossible before. Simply put, PBM lets you define rules or policies to govern your SQL Server enterprise. You can enforce naming conventions, prevent certain object creations, get notifications if a rule you defined is broken, and much more. CMS lets you organize and manage your instances using predefined groups from a single common point. Have you ever wanted to run a code block against multiple instances at the same time? CMS lets you easily do this and more. See how these two features can add a whole new level of manageability to your environment and reduce the time you spend achieving your management goals.

## Title: SQL Server Showdown
## Description:
### If you are feeling pressure to get into the cloud but don't know where to start, you are not alone. Microsoft has offered some form of "cloud" SQL since 2010, but many DBAs and developers are still in the dark about what the cloud really offers. This introductory session will give you an understanding of the different SQL Server platforms available and what they can do for you, turning any fear and uncertainty you might have had into confidence and excitement.

We'll begin with a review of the three SQL Server platform offerings:
•	Traditional "out of box" SQL Server
•	Windows Azure SQL Database
•	Windows Azure VM-hosted SQL Server

We’ll compare the platforms against each other, going over the pros and cons of each, and then work through some use cases and demos on how each offering can help you meet the needs of your business. We’ll see that the cloud platforms need not be seen as replacing traditional “out of box” SQL Server deployments but rather as additional weapons in your arsenal.

Event Date: 18-10-2013 13:00 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Michael Antonovich
## Title: Introducing Cube World to Users from Flat Table Land
## Description:
### This session will explore the tabular approach to building cubes in SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 for DBAs and developers who are more comfortable working with relational databases than cubes. Starting with a “normal” relational database, we’ll see how to build a basic model by loading data from several data sources, how to establish relationships between these data sources, and how to define measures and dimensions, build hierarchies, create KPIs, and deploy functional cubes that can be used to answer management’s questions about what is really going on with the organization’s data. If you’re already familiar with PowerPivot, this session will provide a good transition into the world of SSAS, as both use essentially the same techniques.

## Speaker(s): Bob Pusateri
## Title: Whatcha Doin'? Passive Security for Hostile Environments
## Description:
### Ideal database security settings may exist in books, but rarely in reality. Is your CIO a member of the sysadmin role because they demanded it? Or maybe some users have rights for purely political reasons? Just because you can't enforce security through typical means doesn't mean you're powerless.

Attend this session to learn about the SQL Server features that allow you to keep track of what your users are up to at all times and sleep a little easier. Through various scenarios and demos, you’ll see how technologies such as event notifications, auditing, and extended events can help ensure nothing happens on your system without you knowing about it. Even in optimally secured environments, these techniques can come in handy. The best security is often that which cannot be seen.

## Speaker(s): Michael Fal
## Title: Monitoring Methodologies: The Hierarchy of Database Needs
## Description:
### In any enterprise environment, there are thousands of problems to struggle with – along with another thousand metrics with which to evaluate and troubleshoot those problems. We already have well documented ways to investigate specific problems, such as I/O bottlenecks, poor query performance, and memory pressure. What we need is an actual road map for designing an overall monitoring solution. 

The Hierarchy of Database Needs fills this gap by providing a clear plan for building enterprise database monitoring. Based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, the methodology outlines six levels of database monitoring areas to address. Each level builds on the level below it, covering specific database concerns, such as backups, service availability, strategic solutions, tool selection, and service level agreements.  You’ll walk away with a clear plan for building an overall monitoring strategy for your own database environment.

## Speaker(s): Kendal Van Dyke
## Title: SQL Server Disaster Recovery and High Availability Overview
## Description:
### When it comes to disaster recovery and high availability with SQL Server, there are a lot of options. Most business owners (and many DBAs) lump disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA) together. And while they do share some pieces, they also call for different strategies. Should you use one or more of these options? And what criteria should you use to make the choice? It’s important that you understand the decision tree that can guide you to select the right option(s) for your organization and that you can clearly explain those choices to the stakeholders. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but it is complicated.

## Speaker(s): Christina Leo
## Title: T-SQL Fundamentals: Logical Processing Order
## Description:
### “Column dbo.xyz" is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.” Seen it, fixed it, but can we explain why we’re getting a syntax error in the first place? The optimizer must follow a very specific hierarchy to generate a plan. When you understand the hierarchy, you can better understand the optimizer’s behavior.
 
This all-demo session will explain the logical processing hierarchy, giving you the foundational knowledge you need to build well-structured queries that keep the optimizer happy. You’ll learn how the FROM clause is processed, why a calculated column’s alias can’t be addressed in the JOIN, why WHERE isn’t the only filter, and why NULL confuses everything. When you leave, you’ll think very differently about how you build your queries, and the query optimizer will love you for learning to speak its language.

# SSIS Package Failed in Production? Here’s How to Troubleshoot
#### [Back to calendar](#id-25)
Event Date: 18-10-2013 16:15 - Category: Regular Session (75 minutes) - Track: BI Platform Architecture, Development & Administration
## Speaker(s): Reza Rad
## Title: SSIS Package Failed in Production? Here’s How to Troubleshoot
## Description:
### After deploying SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages and projects into production, you might see that some packages crashed or an error was reported. In many cases, you can’t install SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) on production systems, but in some cases, you will need to troubleshoot packages in production versus in your development environment.

This session reveals some methods for troubleshooting failed SSIS packages in a production environment without SSDT, including using extensive logging, error handling in packages, data taps, and more. We will also explore some extensions for SSIS, such as an extension for execution order of packages that helps control execution in production and helps you find the root cause of the error in production.

## Title: "R" vs "M": Languages for Data Exploration
## Description:
### The new Data Explorer Excel add-in is a great data-exploration toolset, especially combined with other add-ins such as PowerPivot, Power View, and GeoFlow. This session will take a deep dive into the language behind Data Explorer: "M". We will tour the language concepts and capabilities and then compare them with another cool kid in town: "R," the language for statistical computing and data mining.

What possibilities do these languages offer, where can you best use them, and how good is their integration with the Microsoft stack? We’ll answer these questions and more. Join us for this demo-driven session and get a good start on how to work with these two languages.

## Title: Mouth Wide Shut: Interviews from the Other Side of the Table
## Description:
### You’re a DBA, and it’s finally your turn to conduct an interview. As it turns out, asking the questions is nearly as hard as answering them! And listen to those answers: This guy has “master” and “expert” all over his resume, but he sounds like a mid-level the more he talks – and will likely turn out to be a junior once hired.

In this interactive session, we’ll show you the most effective ways to find out what the candidate really knows. You’ll learn about effective tech screening, drawing answers out of nervous candidates, and how to use probing questions to really determine the applicant’s true expertise. 

Join this session to learn:
• How to pick up on resume “inaccuracies”
• How to truly vet a candidate’s skills
• Why keeping your mouth shut is a vital interviewing skill
• The one thing that interviewers never do (and should)

## Title: Parallel Query Execution
## Description:
### Parallel execution is one of the least understood areas of SQL Server, despite the feature being in the product since version 7.0. This session will demonstrate how parallel execution works, how to interpret parallel execution plans, and how to recognize and debug problems particular to parallel execution.

You’ll see intra-query parallel deadlocks and a parallel query that executes faster using fewer resources than the equivalent single-threaded plan. You’ll also discover the true meaning of the misunderstood CXPACKET wait type and learn how to force parallel execution for that large, complex query you have that refuses to “go parallel” on its own.
