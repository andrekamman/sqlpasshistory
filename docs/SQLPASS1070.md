## Speaker(s): Kevin Kline
## Title: Performance Coaching for DBA Teams
## Description:
### What if someone could tell you as a DBA team what you should be focusing your time on, based on well-vetted and empirically tested research? If only such a thing existed! Well, it does. In this session, you will learn important concepts to give your DBA team powerful tools to operate at peak performance and focus on the activities and behaviors which provide the greatest value to your organization. We will answer questions like:

•	What is the Information Management Maturity Model (IMMM) and how can it help your team perform better? How does your career normally evolve with experience, and where you are now versus you think you should be?
•	What are common organizational, process, and interpersonal problems that DBAs face and how can they best be overcome?
•	What behaviors and habits are proven to make a DBA team indispensable, including in the coming age of the cloud? 

This session puts it all in perspective teaching you the core tenets of the Capability Maturity Model focusing on Information Management. Once you learn what you should be doing, you’ll never approach your job as a DBA the same way again!

## Speaker(s): Christine Assaf
## Title: Giving Feedback: How to Effectively Communicate to your Employees
## Description:
### As a manager or team leader giving effective feedback is vital to the success of projects. Managers often ascend the hierarchy due to their technical skill set, but rarely learn ways to successfully communicate with their team. 
 
 In this session, we will discuss soft skills and best practices to give feedback. We’ll learn the essentials for an interaction and how to prepare for tough conversations. Using sample coaching conversations, we’ll run through examples to help you prepare for your next tough dialog. Whether it is a simple coaching sit down, or performance improvement related, and even disciplinary actions, learn how to handle confrontation tactfully.

# Relate & Communicate: Building Bridges and Connecting with Others

Event Date: 10-10-2019 22:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Other (Professional Development)
## Speaker(s): Tom Crea
## Title: Relate & Communicate: Building Bridges and Connecting with Others
## Description:
### “68% of recruiters rate communication skills among the most important”
• Is it any surprise that the most influential leaders also happen to be the best communicators? 
• What if you knew how everyone on your team or how your customers preferred to communicate?
• What if you could connect with anyone?  

Excellent interpersonal skills are the most powerful skills you can possess and miscommunication occurs when we overlook or ignore different styles.  Building successful relationships requires more than a “meet them half-way” approach.  To banish this limited mindset and enjoy deeper relationships, you have to learn how to connect with others.

In this fun, engaging and interactive session, you’ll learn to answer two basic questions: 
• Introvert or extrovert? 
• People- or task-oriented? 

This program will show you how to recognize and respond to varying communication styles, especially critical within any collaborative environment.Not only will this program help you professionally, but in your personal life, social gatherings, and everything in between. You will learn to identify each of four communication styles, FAST— with insights you can begin applying that very day. You’ll enhance your ability to influence others—on the job, with customers, and even at home.

## Title: Certification Exams Inside Out
## Description:
### Preparing for Microsoft certification? Do you want insight into how certification exams are written, how questions are designed, and how to follow a logical process of elimination? We'll go through the process of item creation from an item writer's viewpoint, what rules item writers must follow, and why questions sometimes have strange phrasing. For any technical skillset pursuing certification, we'll review non-technical sample questions and walk through the process of using information at your disposal. You'll better understand how to deconstruct the problem statement. We'll leave time for Q&A with a veteran of the Microsoft certification exam writing process.

## Speaker(s): Brian Kelley
## Title: Career Security - Failure, Skill sets, and Emotional Intelligence
## Description:
### We all want career security: knowing that if we need a job, we have the ability to quick get a job that'll cover what we have to have. In this presentation we'll look at three things you can do to improve your career security. First, we'll talk about failure and how we can use it to move forward. Everyone experiences failure. Not everyone utilizes failure to get better. The better you're able to make those occurrences of failure work for you, the better your career security will be. We will them cover diversifying skills. Being an expert is great, except expert slots tend to be rare. If you can't find one open, what else can you do? The more skills you have, the more options you open up. However, picking the right skills is important. We'll look at how to expand smartly. Finally, we'll cover emotional intelligence. More than just "soft skills," it's an area in which we can all improve - understanding ourselves and others better and acting accordingly.
