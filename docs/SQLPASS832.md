## Title: SQL Server Security
## Description:
### With increased focus on data breaches, security issues and privacy laws, organizations are feeling greater pressure to provide sufficient data protection. GDPR brings substantial fines and potentially criminal prosecution. Are you ready? Are your database systems ready?

During this full day Precon, we will review a variety of ways to secure your SQL Server databases and data from attack.  In this session we will review proper network designs, recommended firewall configurations, and physical security options.  We will also review data encryption options, password protection options, using contained databases, and Always On Availability Groups security. 

There will also be discussions about additional measures which should be taken when working with Internet-facing applications. From there we will move to the most common attack vector: SQL Injection. We will include all the ways that attackers can use SQL Injection to get into your system and how to protect against it.  The security options for database backups is the next topic on the list followed by proper SAN security designs.  We will then finish up by reviewing the auditing options which are available against a database and how they can be used to monitor everything else which we've just talked about during the day.

## Title: Performance-Centric T-SQL
## Description:
### This seminar covers advanced aspects of T-SQL querying and programming with a performance-centric focus. The seminar demonstrates practical uses of T-SQL features, with optimized and polished solutions, many of which were developed by the speaker. You will learn about features like the APPLY operator, window functions, the OFFSET-FETCH filter, and how to use them creatively to solve common T-SQL tasks elegantly and efficiently. You will learn about optimization thresholds and understand when the query optimizer tends to choose one algorithm versus another, and how new adaptive query processing capabilities enable SQL Server to make such choices dynamically during query execution. The seminar also covers other recent and future-planned additions to T-SQL like system-versioned temporal tables, string splitting and concatenation with the STRING_SPLIT and STRING_AGG functions, SQL Graph, and more.

## Title: Modernize Your SQL Server with Bob Ward, the Tiger Team, and CSS Escalation Engineers
## Description:
### SQL Server is known for its innovation, performance, and powerful easy-to-use tools – as well as security and high availability for mission critical workloads. Notable releases like SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 have likely worked well for you, but with the end of support life looming in July 2019, what are your next steps?

This session will walk you through practical options for modernizing older releases of SQL Server. There are lots of choices and the engineers at Microsoft are here to guide you and find the right solutions to help you modernize your systems.  In this full day session, Bob and the Microsoft engineering team will go over the benefits of newest releases, such as SQL Server 2016 and 2017, that provide built-in features for performance, intelligent diagnostics, security, HADR, and Machine Learning – now accessible on Linux and Docker containers.  Plus, they’ll also go in-depth on Azure Managed Instance, a new cloud PaaS offering that makes moving to Azure far easier for the data professional. If you are using an older release of SQL Server and need a detailed plan to modernize to the latest products and services, this session is for you.

Join Bob Ward, the Tiger Team, and top CSS Escalation Engineers for a day of learning, covering:
•	Your choices for modernizing.
•	Tools and techniques for migration.
•	Security, availability and performance benefits of the latest releases. 
•	Tools they use for troubleshooting common issues around performance and the storage engine. 

This session will be full of technical details on all of these topics plus demos and samples you can take with you.  We promise you will walk away with the technical expertise you need to make an immediate impact in your organization.

## Title: Master Git in a Day
## Description:
### Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know that git is the most popular source control management in development shops today.  And for good reason; its power overshadows tools you may have used in the past, such as Subversion or Team Foundation Server. While most developers and companies know this, making the switch can be painful.  It’s all too common to lose code or introduce bugs because of difficulties merging or resolving conflicts. But fear not - by attending this course, you can accelerate your comfort and knowledge with git in just one day.  We’ll cover concepts and capabilities as we walk through exercises with real code. We’ll resolve conflicts, squash commits, stomp on other people’s code, fix our mistakes, introduce bugs (and then use git to find them), tag our commits, and more.  All exercises will be performed on the command line, so you’ll truly understand what’s happening without the aid of GUI-based tools.

## Speaker(s): Rob Mandeville
## Title: Five DevOps Essentials for Better DBA and Developer Collaboration
## Description:
### &lt;i&gt;Presented by SolarWinds&lt;/i&gt;

For many software-as-a-service (SaaS) and Web-enabled businesses, database performance issues in production can cause a steady, relentless drain in business performance. In fact, some estimate that as much as 70% of application performance problems are caused by problems with the database. 

These problems that plague application performance have much in common with the problems that have led many CIOs to adopt Agile development practices and DevOps approaches to streamlining service delivery.

In this presentation, SolarWinds database evangelist, Janis Griffin describes specific actions that can be taken to build a proactive application and database performance monitoring practice that is shared throughout the development and IT organizations. Such a proactive approach serves to demonstrate the strategic value of IT in developing and delivering business - driven services, and contributes significantly to an organization’s overall success.

## Speaker(s): Enrico van de Laar
## Title: Moving Advanced Analytics to Your SQL Server Databases
## Description:
### Traditionally advanced analytical solutions, like machine learning, require you to bring your relational data to the machine learning model. Your model would then perform a prediction and return the results. While the process described above is reliable, it involves moving your data between the database where it is stored and the location where your model resides. This also means an increase in the complexity of your analytical solutions. For instance, how do you trigger the scoring of new data as soon as it enters the database? Or, how can you design this process for real-time scoring?
With the release of SQL Server 2016 Microsoft integrated a solution to the questions above, in-database analytics, allowing you to bring the analytics to your data instead of the other way around. Through in-database analytics we can design, train and score models directly from SQL Server without moving data out and back into the database.

# Getting Better Query Plans by Improving SQL’s Estimates

Event Date: 07-11-2018 13:30 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Application Development
## Speaker(s): Brent Ozar
## Title: Getting Better Query Plans by Improving SQL’s Estimates
## Description:
### You’ve been writing T-SQL queries for a few years now, and when you have performance issues, you’ve been updating stats and using OPTION (RECOMPILE). It’s served you well, but every now and then, you hit a problem you can’t solve. Your data’s been growing larger, your queries are taking longer to run, and you’re starting to wonder: how can I start getting better query plans?

The secret is often comparing the query plan’s estimated number of rows to actual number of rows. If they’re different, it’s up to you – not the SQL Server engine – to figure out why the guesses are wrong. To improve ’em, you can change your T-SQL, the way the data’s structured and stored, or how SQL Server thinks about the data.

This session won’t fix every query – but it’ll give you a starting point to understand what you’re looking at, and where to go next as you learn about the Cardinality Estimator.

## Speaker(s): Edward Pollack
## Title: Finding Islands, Gaps, and Clusters in Complex Data
## Description:
### Gaps and islands problems are often treated as academic problems that are discussed without relevant real-life problems to solve.

By subdividing a data set into meaningful groups of islands, we can perform analytics against it that would otherwise be slow, error-prone, or seemingly impossible!

Data clustering can be applied to complex data sets in order to answer questions about winning streaks, financial performance, monitoring/alerting, goal achievement, and more!

Data quality becomes critical when crunching data in this fashion. We address duplicate data, bad data, NULL, and any other unexpected weirdness that a user might throw at us.

This is a fast-paced session that delves into methods that can be applied to any data. A complete set of historical baseball records will be used as our imperfect sample data for everything from a player's hitting streak to the longest winning streak by a team on Wednesdays at night.

### Have you always wondered what aspects of SQL Server you should be monitoring to make a real difference? Are you new to this side of SQL Server or simply never had the time to implement a performance monitoring strategy? If you answered yes to either, then this session is for you. We will cover the fundamental techniques and code snippets that will help you get to the bottom of who or what may be causing you problems. Learn how to use the tools that are readily available to you in order to effectively identify areas where performance may be affecting your SQL Server instance. We will then discuss the proper steps to address or even prevent the issues going forward. You will come away with not only a new-found confidence but the actual code to help monitor your SQL Server instance on a daily basis. Experience will always play a vital role in feeling comfortable with advanced performance monitoring but this session can get you started with the fundamentals as soon as you get back home.

## Title: Disaster Recovery & High Availability on the Azure Data Platform
## Description:
### While the Azure platform provides built-in safety mechanisms, these are not always well understood. Further, a good architect will ensure redundancy even within an already protected system. This session will show how the Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings such as Azure SQL Database, Azure MySQL and Azure Managed Instance, are built and maintained by Microsoft to provide protection for your vital information. We’ll also go over methods you can employ to add additional protection to your systems. Moving to the cloud and taking advantage of all that it offers doesn’t mean your data is automatically, fully protected. The knowledge from this session will help to ensure a higher degree of safety, faster recovery, and more up-time for your databases on the Azure Data Platform.

## Title: Meet Dapper: The Powerful Alternative to Entity Framework
## Description:
### The team behind StackOverflow built a C# ORM tool around one central concept: performance. Then, they gave it away. In this session, we will get to know Dapper and see just how easy it is to put in our code. In just a few lines of code, we will connect to SQL, call a stored procedure with parameters, and get back a set of strongly-typed POCO objects to work with. From there, we will move right into the more advanced cases including multiple datasets, output parameters, and more. This demo-rich session will be a practical how-to on getting going with Dapper and SQL. All demo code, including helper libraries to boost your performance with Dapper, will be included at the end of the session.

## Speaker(s): Dan Mallott
## Title: New Frontiers: Platform Independent Full Stack Development
## Description:
### For years, those of us who wanted to use non-Windows-based machines to do .NET or SQL Server development have been caught in a "worst of both worlds"-type of situation. We have had to use some sort of Windows VM or have had to go without a local copy of SQL Server. The good news is that thanks to Microsoft's efforts, we can now do full stack .NET development without ever touching a Windows VM or work arounds! In this talk, I'll live code a simple service with database back-end while introducing platform independent tools such as Visual Studio Code, SQL Operations Studio and SQL Server for Docker. Along the way, I'll discuss key differences and limitations between the Windows tools and their platform independent counterparts.

### There are three main ways to deploy Always On Availability Groups (AGs) and Always On Failover Cluster Instances (FCIs) - physical hardware, virtualized, and IaaS in the public cloud. Starting with SQL Server 2017, we now also have the ability to use Windows Server or Linux. While some things are the same, each of the possible permutations and combinations affect how you plan, deploy, and administer AGs and FCIs. This session cuts right to the chase and will give you top tips and tricks for successfully deploying and administering AGs and FCIs so you can be an availaility hero no matter where you are deploying or what operating system you are using.

## Speaker(s): David Maxwell
## Title: Understanding and Implementing System-Versioned Temporal Tables
## Description:
### In many industries, it is necessary for data professionals to be able to show what a data set looked like at a previous point in time. Whether it's calculating tax or insurance rates based on a contract date, quickly comparing data changes over time for trend analysis or just recovering from an accidental data change, it's useful to be able to look back in time through our data. Starting in SQL Server 2016, system-versioned temporal tables provide a solution that tracks data through time with far less overhead than previously offered solutions. This session will cover the basics of temporal tables, how SQL Server manages data within those tables, and how to query data at a specific point in time using several real-world examples. We will also cover the mechanics of data retention and storage and archival of historical data. Attendees will leave with a fundamental understanding of practical use cases for temporal tables and the knowledge required to implement them successfully.

## Title: Build a Metadata-Driven ETL Repository with Biml and SSIS
## Description:
### Your boss tells you that a new field will be added to one of your vendor’s data files, and asks how long it will take to update the ETL to support this change. You start thinking through all of the pieces: the source packages, staging tables, stored procedures, and business rules. It could take weeks just to add a single column!
Managing metadata is one of the most important and time-consuming challenges an ETL developer will face. Simple changes can translate into many hours of discovery, code changes, and testing. However, there are ways to more easily manage this using tools you already have access to, which will ease the burden of SSIS package creation and maintenance.
In this demo-packed session, we will discuss ETL metadata management using SSIS and Biml. We will review the challenges posed by “metadata guessing”, and will show a more predictable and robust way by building an end-to-end metadata repository to manage data types, sources and destinations, and transformations.

## Title: Modern Data Warehousing - The Lambda Approach to Azure BI
## Description:
### Technology changes quickly - patterns and approaches less so. As people move towards the cloud, there are clear benefits of adopting a polyglot cloud architecture, employing a range of distributed components.

This session will take you through the pattern known as the Lambda architecture, a reference pattern for building data analytics systems that can handle any combination of data velocity, variety and volume. The session will outline the set of tools and integration points that can underpin the approach. Do you design real-time reporting systems? Or crunch petabytes of data? Perhaps you are adopting a cloud architecture and just want to handle anything the future throws at you? This session is for you.

We will follow the movement of data through batch and speed layers via Azure Data Lake Store & Analytics and Streaming Analytics before considering the serving layer with Azure SQL DataWarehouse and downstream reporting tools.

## Title: GoEasy’s Road to Real-Time Analytics
## Description:
### &lt;i&gt;Presented by HVR&lt;/i&gt;

In this session, Anu Oladele, Director of Data Science & Business Insights from GoEasy and Joe DeBuzna, VP of Field Engineering—HVR, will discuss how they worked together to architect a solution that enabled GoEasy to achieve real-time business insights and faster loan processing speeds. 
GoEasy’s business model centers on its ability to make fast decisions on loan applications. This means the company must get necessary data into loan officers, managers, and executives hands as quickly as possible. 

The company uses a Software as a Service (SaaS) based loan management system running on SQL Server to track all the loans it books and funds and to manage the lifecycle of each loan. goeasy brings data from the loan management system into a data warehouse, which also runs on SQL Server, to allow business users to report on and analyze the activity and performance of its loan portfolio. 

Previously, the loan management system used a daily batch process to download, compress, transform, and load data into the data warehouse. The large size of the database meant that data wasn’t getting through quickly enough, and GoEasy wanted to have the ability to improve its loan turn-around times.

Join this technical session to hear more from Oladele and deBuzna as they discuss the solution architected to enable GoEasy to improve load turn-around times with the use of log-based change data capture. Find out the challenges and considerations needed to for a new architecture and how they made transition from ETL processing to real-time so that teams at GoEasy were working with the most relevant and up-to-date information for decision making.

## Title: Principle of Least Privilege: The Key to Strong Security
## Description:
### A truly strong security model starts with no permissions and adds what is necessary to allow the user or application to do their assigned task - no more, no less. This is called the Principle of Least Privilege. It's a simple concept, but it can be quite difficult to implement in practice, especially if the prevailing practice has been much more permissive.

In this session, we'll talk about the Principle of Least Privilege in more detail, and we'll discuss ways to implement it for the three primary classes of users - general users, applications, and administrators. Each has their own set of needs that requires a separate approach to allowing the security to meet those needs. You'll leave with actionable ideas on ways that you can improve your company's security while minimizing the impact of the changes.

## Speaker(s): Hamish Watson
## Title: Test Driven Development in SQL Server – How to Deploy Code Safer
## Description:
### Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 
TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.

In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code safer.

## Speaker(s): Vern Rabe
## Title: T-SQL Habits and Practices That Can Kill Performance
## Description:
### All too often we are on a project or given a task where the time or financial constraints require us to develop T-SQL “quick-and-dirty”. Or maybe we have been tasked with quickly improving the performance of some existing T-SQL. These situations often lead to code that later needs to be tuned for better performance. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could satisfy those tight time constraints while also avoiding many of the pitfalls that later plague performance?
In this session we will see ten common T-SQL writing habits that contribute to poor performance. We’ll see WHY each of these patterns can have such negative impact on performance, including examples, and we’ll see one or more alternatives for each that don’t have the same negative impact.
Armed with this knowledge, you will definitely impress your boss with your ability to create fast T-SQL within tight time constraints, and also quickly fix existing T-SQL code. Enjoy the merit raise you’ll get due to your new tuning talents.

## Speaker(s): Kevin Feasel
## Title: Getting Started With Apache Spark
## Description:
### As companies work to gain insight from ever-increasing amounts of data, data platform practitioners need tools which can scale along with the data.  Early big data solutions in the Hadoop ecosystem assumed that data sizes overwhelmed available memory, emphasizing heavy disk usage to coordinate work between nodes.  As the cost of memory decreases and the amount of memory available per server increases, we see a shift in the makeup of big data systems, emphasizing heavy memory usage instead of disk.  Apache Spark, which focuses on memory-intensive operations, has taken advantage of this hardware shift to become the dominant solution for problems requiring distributed data.  In this talk, we will take an introductory look at Apache Spark.  We will review where it fits in the Hadoop ecosystem, cover how to get started and some of the basic functional programming concepts needed to understand Spark, and see examples of how we can use Spark to solve issues like calculating PageRank and analyzing large data sets.

## Speaker(s): James McGillivray
## Title: Windowing Functions: How Spying on Neighbors Enhances Your Data 
## Description:
### One of the simplest ways to enhance the value of the information we provide is to add context. Supplementing each data point with information from a larger data set is a common way of adding this context. In T-SQL, we achieve this by using Windowing Functions. 

In this demo-heavy session, we will walk through the uses of Windowing Functions, from simple row orders to more complicated calculations like rolling averages. We'll explore each keyword in turn, building more sophisticated functions as we do. Each concept is illustrated in a visual, and SQL example so it is clearly understood.

So whether it's tracking a value against the previous row, creating running totals, or a rolling sum, when you walk out of this session, you'll be able to write a windowing function to make it happen.

# Deep Dive in DAX Evaluation Context
#### [Back to calendar](#id-832)
Event Date: 09-11-2018 14:00 - Category: General Session (75 minutes) - Track: Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing
## Speaker(s): Alberto Ferrari
## Title: Deep Dive in DAX Evaluation Context
## Description:
### Ever struggled with a formula in DAX that does not compute what you want? It's happened to us many times and we know that the problem is always (really: ALWAYS) related to the evaluation context. Filter context, row context, and context transition, are only the starting point of a deep dive in how DAX computes the evaluation context for a formula.

During the session, you will see several examples of formulas that lead to unexpected results and learn the unifying theory of evaluation contexts based on expanded tables, filter context operators and blocking semantic. If you are serious about DAX, this session is a real must.

## Title: TempDB: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly
## Description:
### If you ask 100 SQL Server DBAs what their biggest headaches are, at least 99 of them will say something to do with TempDB.  Over the years, there have been many different recommendations about configuration options for TempDB and they have changed over time.  The behavior of TempDB has also changed over time.  What hasn't changed is the criticality of TempDB and how its proper use and configuration can have major implications in the performance of your application.  In this session we will discuss some of the improvements with TempDB in the latest versions of SQL Server and what good TempDB practices look like today.  We will also discuss some application best practices to ensure that you get the best performance possible from workloads that rely heavily on TempDB.

## Speaker(s): Jeff Renz
## Title: Introduction to the R Programming Language for BI Professionals
## Description:
### The modern BI professional is taking on the challenge of operationalizing data science. Most BI developers are very strong in TSQL but their exposer to advanced statistics and visualizations were limited by what is available in the TSQL language. The R programming language allows us to clean, visualize, and apply advanced statistical methods to data. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to use R Studio to generate and test R scripts; generate R visuals in PowerBI; call R code in machine learning workflows; and execute R code in SQL Server. Additionally, I will cover these R programming fundamentals: creating and assigning variables; performing simple calculations; understanding R data types; vectors; matrices; factors; lists; data frames; and ggplot2 graphics.

## Speaker(s): Ike Ellis
## Title: Automated Testing in an Enterprise Data Architecture
## Description:
### Testing tools are very mature in the software development side of the house, but very immature in the business intelligence/reporting side.   As the transactional developers release faster and faster, this is putting a burden on the business intelligence professionals.  As we strive to keep up, teams are struggling with providing a consistent, reliable solution where bugs don't repeatedly surface.  Couple that with the fact that in data warehousing, we move data from the source to several different places, while using many different tools.  It becomes difficult to untangle where the bug exists and to prove the bug was fixed and will never appear again.    Come to this session to arm yourself with data testing strategies that will improve the quality of your data, visualizations, and reports and preserve trust with your users and business stakeholders.

## Speaker(s): Johan Ludvig Brattås
## Title: Implementing a Hybrid Data Warehouse
## Description:
### The last couple of years have seen the emergency of "Big Data", "Cloud" and "Internet of Things". Subsequently, Gartner at the 2016 Gartner Summit in Barcelona declared the Enterprise data warehouse (EDW) as dead. Which of course is silly. Sensible companies don't just throw money out of the window. But they need to adapt and change when new opportunities arrive. Enter the hybrid data warehouse. Combining the power of big data and cloud with your trusty EDW. This session will take a look at a few different approaches to a hybrid data warehouse, with components such as SQLServer 2016, Azure Data Lake, HDInsight, Azure Analysis Services, Azure SQL Data warehouse and Polybase, with some scenarios where the approaches might become relevant. And some pitfalls you need to know about along the way.
