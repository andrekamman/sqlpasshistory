## Title: Azure Machine Learning Studio: Making Data Science Easy(er)
## Description:
### There's so much buzz around Data Science right now.  What is it?  What can I do with it?  Do I need a Ph.D. and a team of super nerds?  In this introductory session, we'll see that Azure Machine Learning Studio's intuitive interface and selection of built-in modules brings the power of Data Science to the people....no advanced degrees necessary.  Bring your data hats and sense of adventure, because the world of data science just got a lot more inviting!

## Speaker(s): Tony McGovern
## Title: Spatial Data Analysis in Power BI
## Description:
### This presentation is aimed at people who want to create beautiful thematic maps and perform impactful spatial data analysis with Power BI. Much of the content will make use of Power BI's out-of-the-box spatial capabilities through Esri's ArcGIS Maps and the MapBox Visual.

While I use data from the United States Census Bureau and the Socrata Open Data APIs, what you'll learn can also be reproduced using similar non-U.S. spatial data.

I'll also highlight some commonly used machine learning models you can integrate with Power BI using the popular statistical programming language, R. From clustering algorithms to hotspot analysis, the combination of ArcGIS, Mapbox, R, and Power BI allows us to deliver better and more rigorous insight from our spatial data.

If you're accustomed to mapping data in Power BI and want to be able to perform advanced spatial analysis and visualize more beautiful maps, this is the session for you.

## Speaker(s): Julie Hyman
## Title: Getting data-driven on a budget
## Description:
### Organizations know they need to be more data-driven but many feel unprepared (and possibly unbudgeted) to implement an intensive full data science-driven analytics platform.  What if you are ready to get more value from your data but aren't sure what options are available? And what about data integration?  Learn more about successful models that you can implement to up your analysis game, including empowering your current data and business analysts to meet their own reporting and data prep needs.  

Join us on this webcast to learn about the different approaches to analytics within organizations and what solutions you may wish to consider as you move to be more data-driven.

# Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI

Event Date: 28-11-2018 04:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Advanced Analytics
## Speaker(s): Joseph Yeates
## Title: Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI
## Description:
### Power BI reports are typically used for descriptive analysis: a historical look of what has happened. But what if your report could visualize what is likely to happen and recommend what you can do about it now? 

This session will introduce how to start the shift from descriptive to predictive analysis and how you can begin to leverage the power of machine learning in your business intelligence solutions. No previous knowledge of R or predictive modeling is required!

We will cover the basics and best practices of predictive modeling and then these concepts will be applied to create three different predictive models in R. Then we will cover three ways to integrate the predictive power of these models into a Power BI report.

## Title: Beyond IoT Real-time Data Ingestion with Azure Stream Analytics
## Description:
### The desire and expectation to use real-time data is constantly growing, businesses need to react to market trends instantly. In this new data driven age a daily ETL load/processing window isn’t enough. We need a constant stream of information and analytics achieved in real-time. In this session we will look at how that can be achieved using Azure Stream Analytics. Building streaming jobs that can blend and aggregate data as it arrives to drive live Power BI dashboards. Plus, we’ll explore how a complete lambda architecture can be created when combining stream and batch data together.
