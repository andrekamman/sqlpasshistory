## Title: What You Need to Know About SQL Server and Docker Containers
## Description:
### Containers can change the way you develop and deploy your applications. In this presentation you’ll get an end-to-end understanding of how to use containers with SQL Server. First, you’ll see a demo of deploying a new SQL Server container in a meter of minutes. Then you’ll get a walk through of building your first SQL Server container where you’ll setup the container host then pull the SQL Server image from a public repository and use it to create SQL Server containers. Then you’ll see how you can connect to and manage containerized SQL Server instances. Then you’ll dive into the details of container architecture and networking. Next, you’ll get a step-by-step guide to build your own custom SQL Server container images. Here you’ll see how you can control container resource usage as well as how you take control of the container startup process to attach databases.

## Title: Azure SQL Containers
## Description:
### As containers are becoming more and more prevalent, this session provides an introduction to the different options of running containers in Azure. 

I'll cover the following different options for running Docker containers in Azure: 
Azure Container Registry
Azure Container Instances 
Azure Container Services (AKS) 

This session is aimed at SQL Server DBAs and Developers who have some experience with Docker (Docker for Windows) and want to know the different options that are available in Azure. 

Each topic will be backed up with demos which will show how simple it is to get up and running with these technologies.

## Title: Containers - You Better Get on Board
## Description:
### Containers are taking over, changing the way systems are developed and deployed…and that’s NOT hyperbole. Just imagine if you could deploy SQL Server or even your whole application stack in just minutes. You can do that, leveraging containers! In this session, we’ll get your started on your container journey learning container fundamentals in Docker, then look at some common container scenarios and introduce deployment automation with Kubernetes.

## Title: Data Delivery Using Database Clones with SQL Server Containers
## Description:
### SQL Server database clones provide full read/write databases, with delivery of Terabyte class environments in seconds, while consuming less than 40 MB of storage.   Clones are an ideal solution for delivering production data for use in development and test, and can also be used for migration/upgrade projects, such as building clones based on SQL Server 2012 backups, and delivering to SQL Server 2017 Linux containers.
