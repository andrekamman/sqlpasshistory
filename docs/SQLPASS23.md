# A Best Practices Cookbook for Data Mining
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 10-04-2013 08:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Advanced Analytics and Insights
## Speaker(s): Mark Tabladillo, Artus Krohn-Grimberghe
## Title: A Best Practices Cookbook for Data Mining
## Description:
### Data mining increasingly fascinates business people and information technology professionals alike, with the promise of finding meaningful patterns, relationships, and opportunities in our continuously growing volumes of data. There are tried and tested best practices you can follow to begin and improve your data mining efforts. You’re invited to a full-day data mining seminar with Mark Tabladillo and Artus Krohn-Grimberghe to see these best practices in action.    Aimed at the beginning to intermediate data scientist, this pre-conference workshop builds on Mark and Artus’ experience in teaching university students and advising industry clients. Following a cookbook theme for their presentation, they will be explaining and demonstrating their best practices framework by cooking through a data science example from beginning to end, covering these topics:    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;•  How to avoid mythology while establishing a data science investigation  &lt;br/&gt;• How to apply the best artistry in data cleansing and transformation (shaping)  &lt;br/&gt;• How to apply best practices for machine learning algorithms  &lt;br/&gt;• How to communicate your data mining story within and beyond your organization    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presenters have designed specific breaks during the workshop where you can discuss and interact with them and other attendees. Note that these best practices transcend Microsoft SQL Server Data Mining, applying equally to other software, such as Matlab, Octave, R, SAS, SPSS, and Weka. After this workshop, you and your data science team will have the knowledge and best practices to approach small to large data mining challenges with confidence.

# Architecting the Next Generation Information Analytics Platform
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 10-04-2013 08:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker(s): Brian Mitchell, Robert Skoglund
## Title: Architecting the Next Generation Information Analytics Platform
## Description:
### Join this daylong pre-conference seminar for a start-to-finish tour through the life cycle of designing, implementing, and managing a modern Microsoft-based information analytics platform. Microsoft’s Robert Skoglund will serve as your guide, starting at the very beginning with initial problem identification and discovery and moving through requirements gathering and prioritization. The workshop will then address solution architecture and implementation, finishing up with operations management.     You’ll not only see what it takes to build out the information analytics platform, but also the recommended practices for data management of the platform. Come learn about:    &lt;br/&gt; • Data architecture  &lt;br/&gt;• Tools rationalization  &lt;br/&gt;• Data movement  &lt;br/&gt;• Security  &lt;br/&gt;• Data maturity  &lt;br/&gt;• Process and data stewardship  &lt;br/&gt;• Self-service  &lt;br/&gt;• Sharing  &lt;br/&gt;• And more!

# Power to the Business Analyst: Self-Service Microsoft BI
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 10-04-2013 08:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Data Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker(s): Peter Myers
## Title: Power to the Business Analyst: Self-Service Microsoft BI
## Description:
### &lt;p style="color:rgb(91,91,91);"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Bonus session "Why? Where? Spatial Analysis in Excel 2013" – &lt;a href="http://passbaconference.com/Sessions/SneakPeeks/24HOPSession9.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;watch now&lt;/u&gt;!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Business analysts today increasingly need to work directly with, and beyond, the data resources delivered by the IT department. Empowering key individuals in your organization can harness valuable potential and drive success by allowing the people who best understand their requirements to produce and manage their own data solutions. Interestingly, when appropriately managed, a side effect of this empowerment is reduced dependency – and thus, fewer resource demands – on the IT department. Join Peter Myers for this day-long pre-conference seminar designed to introduce and describe self-service business intelligence (SSBI). You’ll explore how to effectively enable business analysts by using Microsoft products and learn key concepts through many real-world demonstrations. And equally as important, you’ll see how your business can ensure that SSBI solutions are effectively managed, monitored, and governed.

# Big Data and NoSQL for Database and BI Pros
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 10-04-2013 08:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Big Data Innovations and Integration
## Speaker(s): Andrew J. Brust
## Title: Big Data and NoSQL for Database and BI Pros
## Description:
### &lt;p style="color:rgb(91,91,91);"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Bonus session "Big Data on the Microsoft Platform" - &lt;a href="http://passbaconference.com/Sessions/SneakPeeks/24HOPSession6.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;watch now&lt;/u&gt;!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;These days, it's difficult to visit a technology Web site – or even a mainstream news site – and not read a story about big data. Big data is at the top of its hype cycle: It’s seemingly everywhere, and even Microsoft is getting into the game.

But what is big data really about? What about its sidekick, NoSQL? And how is any of it germane to business analytics, especially for database administrators, developers, and business intelligence specialists working in enterprise environments? Can Java-based, open-source software such as Apache Hadoop, which runs mostly on Linux, be relevant to SQL Server professionals supporting their organization’s analytics efforts? And if it is relevant, how can we cross-train into this strange new world?

There's good news here, I promise. Much of this technology now runs on Windows, and Microsoft has created tools that make it usable from Visual Studio, Excel, and Microsoft BI. Even more important, working with these technologies in non-Microsoft environments is approachable as well. All you need is a proper introduction to Hadoop, NoSQL, and related technologies that is free of hype and explained in terms a relational database or BI professional can understand.

That's exactly what you'll get in this full-day workshop, as Andrew Brust – a longtime SQL Server author and Microsoft BI influencer who also covers big data for ZDNet – shows you the ropes. You'll learn new skills that are in strong demand in the BI/BA world – and actually understand what you learn. It will be exciting, manageable… and fun. You can do this – come see for yourself.

# Collecting and Defining Users' Analytical Requirements
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 10-04-2013 08:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker(s): Mark Whitehorn
## Title: Collecting and Defining Users' Analytical Requirements
## Description:
### &lt;p style="color:rgb(91,91,91);"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Bonus session "What is Big Data?" – &lt;a href="http://passbaconference.com/Sessions/SneakPeeks/24HOPSession7.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;watch now&lt;/u&gt;!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Business intelligence is all about delivering solutions that provide accurate, rapid answers to users’ analytical questions. In theory, we simply ask the users to define their requirements. In practice, this approach rarely works because it is very difficult for anyone to know and precisely define their complete set of analytical needs. The good news is that as BA/BI architects and specialists, we can help business analytics users determine their requirements – and doing so turns out to be relatively simple.    Spend the day with BI expert Mark Whitehorn to see how it’s done. Instead of asking for a complete set of requirements, for example, you can begin by asking for a relatively small set of specific requirements: “We want to plot unit sales over time” or “We want to investigate how profit varies with different product lines in different stores.” From those requirements, you can extrapolate to a generalized logical model that your users will not only understand but also approve. You can then turn that into a physical model, typically a star schema. This seminar will focus on how to collect the users’ requirements and create the logical model.

This is a big problem. This is also a solvable problem.

Join Drew Minkin, Director, Analytics Solutions, Predixion Software, to learn how his team implemented and deployed a predictive readmissions solution using SQL Server and other components that enables nurses, doctors, and care managers to understand the nature of their facilities readmission risk, who to target for specialized interventions, and what the impact could be.
 
In this session, you will see how Predixion team members interpreted the business drivers into development of a predictive model that they then deployed across the last mile of analytics and integrated into a hospital’s daily processes, solving a real-world business problem for immediate impact.

## Speaker(s): Angel Abundez
## Title: Measuring the Subscription Economy
## Description:
### In today's mobile landscape, many companies – including Spotify, Dropbox, XBox Live, and Audible – rely on a subscription-based business model. Measuring and monitoring subscription data can provide a wealth of information to these organizations, but conventional methods using CRM and ERP systems to track such business simply don’t work. However, several key metrics in membership and revenue can (and should) be used to monitor the health of these kinds of companies.

This session will show you how to dimensionally model the subscription economy and uncover these key metrics. We'll explore lessons learned, team requirements, and the business rules you need to be successful. You’ll be faced with hard questions around “freemium” subscriptions, grace periods, and legacy data – we’ll cover that, too. Then, we’ll end with some good data visualizations you can use to uncover additional value from these critical measures.

## Speaker(s): Rob Collie
## Title: Dark Matter: Domain Experts & Nextgen Spreadsheets Are Our Future
## Description:
### The biggest missing pieces of your organization’s Big Data, data science, or business intelligence strategy aren't “missing” at all – you already have them, if you know where to look. For too long, we have allowed the technology tail to wag the domain expertise dog; organizations that reverse that relationship in a controlled fashion realize dramatic improvements in short periods of time – with improved clarity, greater agility, higher ROI on tech investments, and improved IT-business relations. Cutting-edge fields like Big Data come into focus, allowing you to make high-ROI, low-risk investments.

Come learn how “small” advances in spreadsheet technology open the door to that new culture while simultaneously turning your “Excel problem” into your biggest competitive advantage. Noted spreadsheet sociologist and time traveler Rob Collie leads this interactive discussion: a short introduction of four critical concepts, followed by a menu of discussion topics for audience selection.

## Speaker(s): Dave DuVarney
## Title: Delivering Agile BI Solutions
## Description:
### Many business intelligence teams work within traditional software development life cycles. These cycles follow a waterfall-based approach: Gather all your requirements, do a design, do some development, and then several months later, hopefully there is something for business users to get their hands on. Analytical requirements are significantly more fluid and require a more agile development approach. In this session, you will learn how to set up an Agile BI team. We will cover roles and meeting cadence in an Agile team, tools for tracking user requirements and feedback, and real-world examples of how to break larger analytical needs into small iterations.

## Title: Big Data - Top Ingredient to Improve Healthcare
## Description:
### As healthcare undergoes a major shift toward outcome-based payment and financial models, hospitals now more than ever need to utilize their big data assets to operate optimally and improve patient health. Healthcare providers currently have a treasure trove of data that can be turned into actionable information to improve operations immediately.

In this session, we will discuss using SQL Server to crunch the numbers and maximize resources to ensure that 1) appropriate charges are captured, 2) payer reimbursement is accurate, 3) patient quality and effectiveness is optimized, and 4) manual repetitive tasks can be automated. You’ll see how a Pioneering ACO health system achieved a 3% net revenue increase, 150% productivity increase, and 11-to-1 ROI using predictive analytic solutions. With momentum shifting to outcome-based reimbursement models, you’ll learn how analysis and modeling of patient-centered datasets can provide a foundational pillar to improve population health outcomes and minimize hospital readmissions.
