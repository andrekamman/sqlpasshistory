# A Best Practices Cookbook for Data Mining
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 10-04-2013 08:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Advanced Analytics and Insights
## Speaker(s): Mark Tabladillo, Artus Krohn-Grimberghe
## Title: A Best Practices Cookbook for Data Mining
## Description:
### Data mining increasingly fascinates business people and information technology professionals alike, with the promise of finding meaningful patterns, relationships, and opportunities in our continuously growing volumes of data. There are tried and tested best practices you can follow to begin and improve your data mining efforts. You’re invited to a full-day data mining seminar with Mark Tabladillo and Artus Krohn-Grimberghe to see these best practices in action.    Aimed at the beginning to intermediate data scientist, this pre-conference workshop builds on Mark and Artus’ experience in teaching university students and advising industry clients. Following a cookbook theme for their presentation, they will be explaining and demonstrating their best practices framework by cooking through a data science example from beginning to end, covering these topics:    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;•  How to avoid mythology while establishing a data science investigation  &lt;br/&gt;• How to apply the best artistry in data cleansing and transformation (shaping)  &lt;br/&gt;• How to apply best practices for machine learning algorithms  &lt;br/&gt;• How to communicate your data mining story within and beyond your organization    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presenters have designed specific breaks during the workshop where you can discuss and interact with them and other attendees. Note that these best practices transcend Microsoft SQL Server Data Mining, applying equally to other software, such as Matlab, Octave, R, SAS, SPSS, and Weka. After this workshop, you and your data science team will have the knowledge and best practices to approach small to large data mining challenges with confidence.

# Architecting the Next Generation Information Analytics Platform
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 10-04-2013 08:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker(s): Brian Mitchell, Robert Skoglund
## Title: Architecting the Next Generation Information Analytics Platform
## Description:
### Join this daylong pre-conference seminar for a start-to-finish tour through the life cycle of designing, implementing, and managing a modern Microsoft-based information analytics platform. Microsoft’s Robert Skoglund will serve as your guide, starting at the very beginning with initial problem identification and discovery and moving through requirements gathering and prioritization. The workshop will then address solution architecture and implementation, finishing up with operations management.     You’ll not only see what it takes to build out the information analytics platform, but also the recommended practices for data management of the platform. Come learn about:    &lt;br/&gt; • Data architecture  &lt;br/&gt;• Tools rationalization  &lt;br/&gt;• Data movement  &lt;br/&gt;• Security  &lt;br/&gt;• Data maturity  &lt;br/&gt;• Process and data stewardship  &lt;br/&gt;• Self-service  &lt;br/&gt;• Sharing  &lt;br/&gt;• And more!

# Power to the Business Analyst: Self-Service Microsoft BI
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 10-04-2013 08:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Data Analytics and Visualization
## Speaker(s): Peter Myers
## Title: Power to the Business Analyst: Self-Service Microsoft BI
## Description:
### &lt;p style="color:rgb(91,91,91);"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Bonus session "Why? Where? Spatial Analysis in Excel 2013" – &lt;a href="http://passbaconference.com/Sessions/SneakPeeks/24HOPSession9.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;watch now&lt;/u&gt;!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Business analysts today increasingly need to work directly with, and beyond, the data resources delivered by the IT department. Empowering key individuals in your organization can harness valuable potential and drive success by allowing the people who best understand their requirements to produce and manage their own data solutions. Interestingly, when appropriately managed, a side effect of this empowerment is reduced dependency – and thus, fewer resource demands – on the IT department. Join Peter Myers for this day-long pre-conference seminar designed to introduce and describe self-service business intelligence (SSBI). You’ll explore how to effectively enable business analysts by using Microsoft products and learn key concepts through many real-world demonstrations. And equally as important, you’ll see how your business can ensure that SSBI solutions are effectively managed, monitored, and governed.

# Big Data and NoSQL for Database and BI Pros
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 10-04-2013 08:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Big Data Innovations and Integration
## Speaker(s): Andrew J. Brust
## Title: Big Data and NoSQL for Database and BI Pros
## Description:
### &lt;p style="color:rgb(91,91,91);"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Bonus session "Big Data on the Microsoft Platform" - &lt;a href="http://passbaconference.com/Sessions/SneakPeeks/24HOPSession6.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;watch now&lt;/u&gt;!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;These days, it's difficult to visit a technology Web site – or even a mainstream news site – and not read a story about big data. Big data is at the top of its hype cycle: It’s seemingly everywhere, and even Microsoft is getting into the game.

But what is big data really about? What about its sidekick, NoSQL? And how is any of it germane to business analytics, especially for database administrators, developers, and business intelligence specialists working in enterprise environments? Can Java-based, open-source software such as Apache Hadoop, which runs mostly on Linux, be relevant to SQL Server professionals supporting their organization’s analytics efforts? And if it is relevant, how can we cross-train into this strange new world?

There's good news here, I promise. Much of this technology now runs on Windows, and Microsoft has created tools that make it usable from Visual Studio, Excel, and Microsoft BI. Even more important, working with these technologies in non-Microsoft environments is approachable as well. All you need is a proper introduction to Hadoop, NoSQL, and related technologies that is free of hype and explained in terms a relational database or BI professional can understand.

That's exactly what you'll get in this full-day workshop, as Andrew Brust – a longtime SQL Server author and Microsoft BI influencer who also covers big data for ZDNet – shows you the ropes. You'll learn new skills that are in strong demand in the BI/BA world – and actually understand what you learn. It will be exciting, manageable… and fun. You can do this – come see for yourself.

# Collecting and Defining Users' Analytical Requirements
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 10-04-2013 08:00 - Category: Pre-Conference Session (full day) - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker(s): Mark Whitehorn
## Title: Collecting and Defining Users' Analytical Requirements
## Description:
### &lt;p style="color:rgb(91,91,91);"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Bonus session "What is Big Data?" – &lt;a href="http://passbaconference.com/Sessions/SneakPeeks/24HOPSession7.aspx"&gt;&lt;u&gt;watch now&lt;/u&gt;!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Business intelligence is all about delivering solutions that provide accurate, rapid answers to users’ analytical questions. In theory, we simply ask the users to define their requirements. In practice, this approach rarely works because it is very difficult for anyone to know and precisely define their complete set of analytical needs. The good news is that as BA/BI architects and specialists, we can help business analytics users determine their requirements – and doing so turns out to be relatively simple.    Spend the day with BI expert Mark Whitehorn to see how it’s done. Instead of asking for a complete set of requirements, for example, you can begin by asking for a relatively small set of specific requirements: “We want to plot unit sales over time” or “We want to investigate how profit varies with different product lines in different stores.” From those requirements, you can extrapolate to a generalized logical model that your users will not only understand but also approve. You can then turn that into a physical model, typically a star schema. This seminar will focus on how to collect the users’ requirements and create the logical model.

# Inside Atento: Strategies for a Corporate Data Warehouse
#### [Back to calendar](#id-23)
Event Date: 11-04-2013 10:00 - Category: Breakout Session (60 minutes) - Track: Strategy and Architecture
## Speaker(s): Javier Torrenteras, Enrique Moreno
## Title: Inside Atento: Strategies for a Corporate Data Warehouse
## Description:
### Atento is a call center company with offices in 16 countries. Each country has its own systems to manage and support daily operations, but all use the same processes and business units. The corporate office needed to consolidate all that information and align local indicators with the global business strategy. The company also had isolated data marts, based on different technologies, that weren’t shared across departments, so generating monthly executive reports was time-consuming, requiring lots of manual validation and coordination.

To solve these problems, Atento built an enterprise data warehouse, using Agile methodologies so that business users could quickly evaluate the project’s ROI and be involved as stakeholders in the following phases of the solution. The Azure platform is serving as an interim solution to support the entire BI stack so that it can be easily accessed by corporate and local teams. Come see how they did it.

## Speaker(s): Rod Colledge
## Title: Self-Service Business Analytics in 2013
## Description:
### On its own, self-service analytics struggles to give business users the insights they need. But when combined with a corporate BI platform, the power of self-service analytics shines, and the sometimes toxic relationship between the IT department and business users changes to one of mutual respect and working together to achieve common goals. In this demo-rich session, we’ll explore the use-case scenarios and benefits of self-service business analytics as part of a broader reporting and analytics strategy using SQL Server 2012, SharePoint 2013, and Office 2013.

After laying the foundation, we'll launch into a range of demos covering PerformancePoint dashboards, Report Alerts with SQL Server Reporting Services, Report Parts with Report Builder, Power View, Pivot, and PowerPivot. All demos will show how corporate BI solutions can be extended and enhanced with self-service analytics. We’ll also highlight new analytics features in SharePoint 2013 and Excel 2013 – and when to use each.

## Speaker(s): Mark Whitehorn
## Title: What Is Data Science?
## Description:
### According to the Harvard Business Review*, data scientist is “The sexiest job of the 21st Century.” However, other definitions include, “An analyst who lives in California.” So what is the truth? Is “data science” really a valuable job or marketing hype?

This session will argue that the skills a good data scientist possesses are real and will explain why that particular combination of talents is so valuable. We’ll cover exactly what those skills are during the session, but here is a taste: Data scientists have the ability to take a set of complex data (very often, big data) and find the complex patterns hidden therein. This often involves rapid prototyping and coding in a variety of languages (Java, R, MDX, Erlang). Data scientists have a good statistical background, excellent data visualization skills, and the ability to communicate their ideas clearly to a non-technical audience. Oh, and did I mention curiosity?

## Title: Modern Data Warehousing Strategy
## Description:
### The recent introduction of new technologies such as PowerPivot, the BI Semantic Model, and columnstore indexes in SQL Server and advances in self-service business intelligence and big data might be considered threats to the classic data warehouse ecosystem. In reality, a good data warehouse is still the best starting point for any kind of analysis, but we do need to update our strategy for data warehouse implementation to fit the requirements of this new era.

This session will start the conversation about what a modern strategy for data warehousing can and should be. What type of data modeling should we use for the data warehouse? What is the role of data marts? Does the use of technologies such as PowerPivot or Analysis Services Tabular affect the way we should model our data? Do columnstore indexes remove the need for an analytical server like Analysis Services? We will discuss these and other questions, offering an updated approach to the data warehouse modeling methodology.

## Speaker(s): Cristian Vava
## Title: Analytics for Business Strategy
## Description:
### Strategy has remained one of the few areas of business activity not completely under the spell of business analytics. The main reason has been the unknowns in the supporting data, but other issues – such as overestimating the power of predictive algorithms or ignoring the effect of error propagation in complex computations – have created the impression that business analytics isn’t appropriate for strategy analysis. However, the human mind isn’t infallible either, and knowledge limitations, personal biases, or both often result in inappropriate business strategies.

This session will discuss fundamental issues we encounter in predictive analytics based on deep unknowns and analytics for low and very low probability events and then look at potential solutions. We’ll also analyze how the human mind works and what we can do to extend its capabilities and, thus, complement traditional strategic analysis tools.

## Speaker(s): Dan Clark
## Title: Mastering Time-Based Analysis in DAX
## Description:
### So much analysis that a business typically performs on its data involves dates and/or times. Many organizations, for example, probably need to compare sales from one year to the next or aggregate transactions over time. DAX incorporates many built-in time intelligence functions to help make date- and time-based calculations easier. Although the time intelligence functions are very useful, they can also be misused and give erroneous results. To avoid this, you need to understand which functions to use when and how to use them. 

This session will guide you through the various time intelligence functions available in DAX and provide practical examples of how to correctly use them. We will also cover time intelligence best practices and how to avoid the many “gotchas” that can occur by misapplying these functions.

This session will show you how to dimensionally model the subscription economy and uncover these key metrics. We'll explore lessons learned, team requirements, and the business rules you need to be successful. You’ll be faced with hard questions around “freemium” subscriptions, grace periods, and legacy data – we’ll cover that, too. Then, we’ll end with some good data visualizations you can use to uncover additional value from these critical measures.
